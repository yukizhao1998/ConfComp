;;;","14/Dec/17 21:22;cshannon;This is fixed.  Finding the correct topic requires a little bit of overhead but this is only done if useVirtualDestSubs is set to true and a new virtual topic demand advisory is sent (ie when the consumer comes online) so it shouldn't be run very often unless there are consumers constantly coming online/offline which would cause a lot more cpu in other places as well.  Also, the arrays that are being manipulated/copied are going to generally be very small as they are just the size of a tokenized destination name.  If for some reason this ends up being a performance hit then the resulting computed topics could be stored into a cache so they only have to get computed once per destination.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general durable network subscriptions were not propagating properly when using more than 2 brokers either by not being created at all, not being removed, or even in some cases the same durable was being added twice and causing bridge failures.

This jira includes the following changes to fix these issues:
# Currently proxy network subscriptions are not eligible to be conduit.  For topics it doesn't make sense to not use conduit subscriptions so this should be changed.  For queue subscriptions this can sometimes be useful to conduit as well so I added a new flag for this.  Not allowing conduit topic proxy network subs was causing collisions with durables and breaking bridges
# The durable sync process should only ignore network durable subs for the specific bridge it is syncing, it should still be re-adding subs for other bridges otherwise they will get dropped
# On demand subscription removal, the tracked demand sub should be checked to see if it's a network demand sub and if it still has remote durable subs attached to it.  If it does they need to be cleaned up and removed
# Lastly, when creating a demand subscription the consumerId should only be changed if the consumer is for a direct bridge and not a proxy bridge otherwise the demand won't be properly tracked and removed later ",,brianjohnson,cshannon,jira-bot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Thu Nov 16 12:52:45 UTC 2017,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i3mlon:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"09/Nov/17 16:23;jira-bot;Commit 96ce14b278fef9e5f428f1c3c07ce5c09fd8f9a8 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Introducing a delay before throwing the exception in the client will get around the issue.

[AMQ-6831, AMQ-6771] trigger eofexception on read -1 - AMQ6522Test
;;;","11/Oct/17 11:44;gtully;There is a workaround but it is temporary. Here is the background, there is a problem with AMQ-6771 that speeds up the checkForCorruptJournalFiles. On a restart, it is possible that the check will report corruption when there is none. It is independent of the preallocation strategy or preallocation scope. 
If ignoreMissingJournalFiles=true is configured, this can lead to unnecessary loss of data, otherwise the broker will fail to start and report the corruption and there will be no loss.
If there is no reason to suspect corruption it may be this defect. The defect relates to the parsing of a batch of journal data. If the journal record header crosses a batch boundary at a particular point, the defect can happen. 
Disabling the checkForCorruptJournalFiles will avoid the problem but also changing or varying the read batch size may avoid the problem.
The read batch size is controlled by journalMaxWriteBatchSize which default to 4mb. Setting that to 10mb or some larger number may help. It is a little random but the window for this to occur is quite small. If the journalMaxWriteBatchSize is half of of the journalSize (and there is enough memory) then two reads will parse a journal file and the chance of a batch being on a boundary and hitting this defect is very small.;;;","11/Oct/17 11:49;jira-bot;Commit d66e96e8bc7be51a93835149e132204407d79b5f in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~gtully]

This has been observed causing Websocket related test failures in the ActiveMQ CI jobs and also in Qpid JMS CI jobs (seemingly only since it was updated to use 5.15.0, though this code hasn't changed since introduction in 5.14.0 it appears?).

When supplied with new frame data, there is a check that the WSTransportProxy instance has already been started, and if not a latch wait is performed until it is before proceeding. This latch is tripped during startup but before the transport listener has been set, meaning it is possible for frame data processing to proceed before the listener is actually set on the transport. Also, the listener field isn't volatile so it could additionally be true that the thread processing the data doesnt yet see a listener which has been set on the transport in the startup thread. Moving the latch trip to after setting the listener should address both those issues.",,jira-bot,robbie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Fri Sep 01 12:06:31 UTC 2017,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i3jjpj:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"01/Sep/17 12:01;jira-bot;Commit 2e492569db2345cf3be8532630f93219159a8b15 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gemmellr]

From what I can see, the check for started does not add value and in the event of a failure to fire an advisory the error will be caught and logged rather than being ignored as it is now.",,gtully,jira-bot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Thu Sep 07 16:17:43 UTC 2017,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i3hz6n:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"25/Jul/17 12:02;jira-bot;Commit ddfa96028c4c803467b0c074b8c1b4d3e5f9687d in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

The Arjuna transaction manager of JBoss EAP runs a periodic recovery and calls {{ActiveMQResourceAdapter.TransactionContext.recover()}}
{code}
try {
  original = setConnection(newConnection());
  ...
{code}

Note around the same code path would be executed when Arjuna calls {{commit()}} or {{rollback()}} on the resource adapter.
The call to {{ActiveMQResourceAdapter.newConnection()}} is implemented as

{code}
                        private ActiveMQConnection newConnection() throws JMSException {
                            ActiveMQConnection connection = makeConnection();

                            return connection;
                        }
{code}

Method {{makeConnection()}} calls into {{ActiveMQConnectionFacotry.createActiveMQConnection()}} which contains

{code}
        try {
            connection = createActiveMQConnection(transport, factoryStats);
...
            transport.start();

Now if transport.start() raises an errror, this may not result in an exception in this method. Instead the ""ActiveMQ Connection Executor"" thread is used to call {{ActiveMQConnection.transportFailed()}}. So the handling of the error happens in a different thread. Meanwhile above method {{ActiveMQConnectionFacotry.createActiveMQConnection()}} finishes (without exceptions) and we are back in {{ActiveMQResourceAdapter.$2.newConnection()}} where we call {{connection.start()}} (See code sample above). 

In the meantime the ""ActiveMQ Connection Executor"" thread has most likely finished and marked the connection as failed (ActiveMQConnection.transportFailed = true).
{{ActiveMQConnection.start()}} calls method {{ActiveMQConnectioncheckClosedOrFailed()}} which checks for the value of property {{transportFailed}}, which will be true by now and an exception will be raised.

That exception is only caught in {{ActiveMQResourceAdapter.recover()}} which in its {{finally}} clause calls 

{code}
                            } finally {
                                closeConnection(original);
                            }
{code}

but original is null at this stage, so the ActiveMQConnection instance does not get closed and the ""ActiveMQ Connection Executor"" thread is not shut down! Both, the thread and the instance are leaked!
;;;","12/Jun/17 07:31;tmielke;A fix for this bug is to catch and deal with these Exceptions in method {{ActiveMQResourceAdapter.$2.newConnection()}}

{code:java}
                        private ActiveMQConnection newConnection() throws JMSException {
                            ActiveMQConnection connection = null;

The first thing I see wrong here is that you cannot NACK a message in a TX so that will definitely fail if you try and do it a second time as you've already NACK'd the message.  My guess is that your first ACK is not including the TXID in the ACK an thereby just ACK'ing the message outside the TX.;;;","02/Jun/17 15:50;jira-bot;Commit bd8661796b190ef605458cdd7a0d90d9af4f51a0 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

AMQ-6697 Adds a test to show that the described case works

Correctly ACK inside a TX and then Abort and then ACK again outside a TX
to show that the broker will then mark the message as consumed.

Im not really able to create a PR since I'm aware of the reasoning behind that camel activemq should not be allowed to autowire the sb connectionfactory whereas the camel jms component is  https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/jms/JmsComponent.java#L184

Currently the SB autowirering as described here https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-messaging.html#boot-features-activemq seems broken.

The quickfix would be to allow autowirering again, but I wonder if there are other considerations that has to be taken into account.

Debugging MQTT.js and ActiveMQ I found that the org.apache.activemq.transport.ws.jetty9.MQTTSocket class (in activemq-http module) assumes that a single WebSocket data frame +always+ contains a single MQTT Control Packet.
This is the cause of MQTT.js failure because MQTT.js makes several send over WebSocket for a single MQTT Control Packet (header, length etc).

Accordingly to MQTT OASIS specification ( http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718127 ):

??A single WebSocket data frame can contain multiple or partial MQTT Control Packets. The receiver MUST NOT assume that MQTT Control Packets are aligned on WebSocket frame boundaries.??

And RFC 6455 ( https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt ): 

??The WebSocket message does not necessarily correspond to a particular network layer framing, as a fragmented message may be coalesced or split by an intermediary.??

So I think that ActiveMQ should be fixed to be compliant to the WebSocket and MQTT specifications.

I attached the diff patch file for MQTTSocket which fixes the problem and a new activemq-http module MQTT-WebSocket unit test for this issue (the same of MQTTWSTransportTest but which splits MQTT Frame Packet in multiple WebSocket frames):

MQTTWSPartialFrameConnection.java
MQTTWSPartialFrameTest.java

When writing the unit test I found also a bug in the class org.apache.activemq.transport.ws.MQTTWSConnection.java. 
All the occurrences of: 

{code:java}
ByteSequence payload = wireFormat.marshal(command.encode());
connection.getRemote().sendBytes(ByteBuffer.wrap(payload.data));
{code}
 
should be replaced with:

{code:java}
ByteSequence payload = wireFormat.marshal(command.encode());
connection.getRemote().sendBytes(ByteBuffer.wrap(payload.data, payload.offset, payload.length));
{code}

That is because of the payload.data bytes array buffer in ByteSequenze is bigger than the real MQTT frame packed bytes size, so sending all the payload.data bytes array, ActiveMQ receives much more extra zero-extra bytes. With the current implementation, those extra zero-bytes are ignored and this makes wrongly passes the test (while it should fail because there are ""extra bytes"" which doesn't respect the MQTT protocol).

I attached also the diff patch file for the MQTTWSConnection file.

{code};;;","25/Jun/21 13:24;mattrpav;Users reporting issues with 5.16.1;;;","25/Jun/21 14:42;cshannon;The culprit seems to be the synchronized block here: [https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/activemq-5.16.1/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnection.java#L2386]

The idea here seems to be to delay starting a new thread unless needed but the synchronized block is causing the issue. This could probably be fixed by creating the Scheduler object on connection creation to avoid needing to lock when calling getScheduler(). The call to start() could still be delayed until the first time it is needed because it's thread safe (uses compare/set) 

I can do a quick patch for this

 ;;;","25/Jun/21 14:49;cshannon;On second thought I'm going to probably just still delay object creation and use a different lock or CAS/Atomic to avoid locking on the connection because creating a Scheduler without any purpose would still create a fair amount of empty objects to clean up later for no reason;;;","25/Jun/21 15:37;jira-bot;Commit 3f5abd4433d3dca911ac418d899346e7dd675b7b in activemq's branch refs/heads/main from Christopher L.

AMQ-6660 - Use a separate lock for lazy scheduler creation to prevent
deadlocks

Switch to using a dedicated lock to initialize the Scheduler object
inside of ActiveMQConnection to prevent a deadlock scenario that occurs
when using the intrinsic ActiveMQConnection lock. This is using double
checked locking so this lock will only be contended with during lazy
creation and then will rely on the volatile reference for future reads
and when stopping/closing.

Incorrect logging from KahaDB cleanup task when enableAckCompaction=true,AMQ-6644,13061406,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

Such journal file will only contains the compacted acks, it won't be used to hold messages. 

If the actual journal (to which new messages are written to) has a lower number than the journal files that were created during ack compaction, the periodic cleanup task will not delete any journals that are higher than the actual journal file. So multiple journal files may remain active on disk although there is no single unconsumed message on the broker. 
This in itself is okay, however when trace logging for the cleanup task is enabled, it reports differently, namely that it is going to delete these journals, where in fact it is not deleting them.

E.g. lets take the following example.
The KahaDB folder on disk consists of 
{code}
[kahadb]$ ls -alh
total 54M
drwxr-xr-x.  2 fuse fuse  128K Feb  1 15:50 .
drwxr-xr-x. 13 fuse fuse  4.0K Nov  4 13:14 ..
-rw-r--r--.  1 fuse fuse   32M Feb  1 16:26 db-65.log

-rw-r--r--.  1 fuse fuse  2.5M Feb  1 16:26 db.data
-rw-r--r--.  1 fuse fuse   32M Feb  1 14:51 db-log.template
-rw-r--r--.  1 fuse fuse 1002K Feb  1 16:26 db.redo
-rw-r--r--.  1 fuse fuse     8 Feb  1 14:51 lock
{code}

and the logging says:

{code}
Last update: 65:26636520, full gc candidates set: [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]
gc candidates after producerSequenceIdTrackerLocation:65, [66, 67, 68, 69]
gc candidates after ackMessageFileMapLocation:65, [66, 67, 68, 69]
...
gc candidates: [66, 67, 68, 69]
    ackMessageFileMap: {65=[65]}
Cleanup removing the data files: [66, 67, 68, 69]
{code}

In this example the actual journal file to which msgs are written is 65. The journal files 66-69 were created during ack compaction and have a higher number than 65.
So KahaDB won't delete the journals 66-69 until the actual journal file is moved to journal 70, despite that there are no unconsumed messages on the broker.
However the last log line suggests that it will remove the journals 66-69, but they will not get removed due to rule above. 

We should align the logging output with the logic used to determine which journals to delete.

It usually doesn't make sense to use a connection pool with a DefaultMessageLIstenerContainer because you want to let the DefaultMessageListenerContainer do its own caching.  If you just pass a normal connection factory to the DefaultMessageListenerContainer then it should just create 1 connection and 10 consumers.

From the Spring docs:

""Note: Don't use Spring's CachingConnectionFactory in combination with dynamic scaling. Ideally, don't use it with a message listener container at all, since it is generally preferable to let the listener container itself handle appropriate caching within its lifecycle. Also, stopping and restarting a listener container will only work with an independent, locally cached Connection - not with an externally cached one."";;;","22/Feb/17 14:05;cshannon;Also you said you could reproduce it without using Spring DMLC.

{quote}

I can see your point, but one itchy situation about it is that Apache Camel has long been promoting the combination of {{PooledConnectionFactory}} + DMLC as the best practice ({{camel-jms}} is effectively just a DMLC inside).
http://camel.apache.org/activemq.html#ActiveMQ-Usingconnectionpooling

We could say that Apache Camel has been wrong on this, but please note that the issue happens only when a {{failover:\(...)}} broker URL is used with {{ActiveMQConnectionFactory}} and for a plain {{tcp://...}} URL we see no issues even with the above combination. That's why I think there might be something that can be improved in ActiveMQ side (especially between {{PooledConnectionFactory}} and Failover transport).

Or we could instead argue that the specific combination of Failover transport + PooledConnectionFactory + DMLC is evil; in this case, what do you think would be the correct configuration if users need to use Failover transport?

{quote}
If you just pass a normal connection factory to the DefaultMessageListenerContainer then it should just create 1 connection and 10 consumers.
{quote}

Yes, but then doesn't the number of connection instances grow proportionately to the number of DMLC instances used?  I think that's why people want to use {{PooledConnectionFactory}} in combination with DMLC (or {{camel-jms}}).

{quote}
Also you said you could reproduce it without using Spring DMLC. What was your setup in that case? 
{quote}

Attached {{pooled-amq-client.zip}} is a reproducer that doesn't use DMLC. I admit it's rather a contrived example and mostly just mimics what's being done inside DMLC, but it still reproduces the issue with only ActiveMQ.;;;","28/Feb/17 14:46;cshannon;Right, if you really want to share connections across multiple DMLCs then you'd still need a pooled factory.  I wouldn't say using failover + pooled factory + DMLC is necessarily evil...just that there's a lot going on there that could cause problems and it would simply things if you didn't use a pooled connection factory (such as if you were only a small number of DMLCs) unless you really need it.  And yes Spring doesn't really recommend doing it that way so if you can get away with creating 1 connection per DMLC then that is usually the way to go.

The use case should still work however and there is probably some improvement here that needs to be done in order to properly handle the failover case in this set up so that an excessive number of consumers don't get created.;;;","28/Feb/17 16:16;gtully;I think there is something in this. The consumer creation failing with an exception is not being tracked by the failover transport and when it reconnects, b/c the session is still present b/c it was pooled, it gets recreated along with the failed consumer.
The connection state tracker needs to respond to the failure to create the consumer such that it is not recreated on reconnect. I think.
Will see if I can validate with that test code and peek at a possible fix.;;;","28/Feb/17 16:46;tabish;Creation of MessageProducer would likely also suffer from this issue as it can also fail for security exceptions when access control prevents writes.  ;;;","28/Feb/17 17:17;jira-bot;Commit 8641928553e0f1d97416fd010c2f7d6f165b3660 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

The problem is initDone.compareAndSet(false, true) set TRUE (Thread [ colContainer-1 ]), but executor still null when next Thread ( [ clContainer-1 ]) try to use this shared connection.
In my box it takes 30ms to create Executor after this all works fine.

They run on the same machine, use KahaDB with file locking.
It does not matter if b1 or b2 is started first, it becomes the master.

The other one, the slave, when shutting down - while the master is running - hits a dead-lock; it must be `kill -9`'d manually in the end.

We have a classic dead-lock scenario.  I have attached a `jstack` output when the slave broker is shutting down.

    [AMQ-6601] AMQ with master and slave broker, shutting down slave causes a dead-lock

    This PR addresses the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6601.
    
    The proposed solution is to start the broker asynchronously, but only wait for its starting up if it is the master (i.e. non-slave).
    
    Closes / fixes issue #6601.
    
    Credit goes to @lichtin for coming up with the solution.

The hardware devices I use often have problems during SSL handshake and do not respond any more. So I thought configuring a transport.soTimeout value should solve the problem of hanging connections, because something like the MQTT  transport.defaultKeepAlive check is not applicable in this step yet. But setting transport.soTimeout=30000 had no effect.
I made a remote debug session to the ActiveMQ broker and saw lots of threads waiting at NIOSSLTransport.java Line 430:

    int keyCount = selector.select(this.getSoTimeout());
    if (keyCount == 0 && this.getSoTimeout() > 0 && ((System.currentTimeMillis() - now) >= this.getSoTimeout())) {
        throw new SocketTimeoutException(""Timeout during handshake"");
    }

At this point this.getSoTimeout returns always 0, which results in infinite timeout.
I tried to figure out why the soTimeout setting works not as configured and found the code where the NIOSSLTransport object is created: TcpTransportServer.java function doHandleSocket(Socket socket). Here in line 580:

    options.putAll(transportOptions);

The soTimeout value is already removed from the transportOptions but it was apperantly not applied to the relevant object.

To solve my problem for now I tried if the transport.soTimeout configuration works in a MQTT+SSL Stack (without using NIO) and it worked.

May you please be so kind and solve this issue, so that the transport.soTimeout configurations works during SSL handshake and payload transfer as well for NIO.","Ubuntu 16.04

AMQ-6599 - Properly apply soTimeout value to TcpTransport

The soTimeout value needs to be applied to the TcpTransport as well as
the socket because the NIO transports use the value later on when
establishing a connection

(cherry picked from commit f6bf823dedba54dea40b597f1762ac6d7308ffa6)
;;;","17/Feb/17 13:07;cshannon;The issue was the soTimeout value was being remove from the options map after being applied to the Socket so it was not applied on the TcpTransport itself.  For normal transports this is not a problem but for the NIO transports this causes the soTimeout value to always be 0 later on when it is used on selector.select(soTimeout) as you found.  I'm planning on working on the 5.14.4 release next week so the fix should be out soon.;;;","17/Feb/17 23:23;thomas.winterhalder;Thanks for fixing this issue so fast!

Setup two consumers and producers for two different queues, e.g test.queue.1 and test.queue.2

The consumers should have no client-side redelivery and directly throw an exception when consuming the message to trigger the DLQ mechanism on the broker.

Send around 1000 messages with each producer in a loop.

with PooledConnectionFactory. It works fine at first, but when the broker is
restarted and clients try to reconnect the factory throws
NullPointerExceptions and clients cannot connect. For regular clients I had
to switch to regular factory, and it works fine, but for my camel clients I
need the pooled factory.
When I replace activemq-jms-pool-5.13.4.jar with 5.10.2, it works fine again
every time.
I have not seen any related bugs reported anywhere except for camel forum:http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/NullPointer-org-apache-camel-component-jms-DefaultJmsMessageListenerContainer-td5788071.html
I've done binary search on releases replacing activemq-jms-pool jars and it seens that it works in all releases from 5.10.2 to 5.11.4, and throws NPEs in all releases after 5.12.0.

Normally on clean shutdown the index stores the known set of free pages to db.free and reads that in on start up to know which pages can be re-used.  On an unclean shutdown this is not written to disk so on start up the index is supposed to scan the page file to figure out all of the free pages.

Unfortunately it turns out that this scan of the page file is being done before the total page count value has been set so when the iterator is created it always thinks there are 0 pages to scan.

The end result is that every time an unclean shutdown occurs all known free pages are lost and no longer tracked.  This of course means new free pages have to be allocated and all of the existing space is now lost which will lead to excessive index file growth over time.",,alanprot,cshannon,gtully,jgenender,jgoodyear,jira-bot,lichtin,rwagg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMQ-7082,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Sun Oct 21 17:29:22 UTC 2018,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i39ivz:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/Feb/17 12:06;jira-bot;Commit 38d85be476a06fe9a1f60b4f38232d64a6d0398a in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

There have been reports of more than 2mins to start and the threads are stuck in sequence.set add. AMQ-7055 helps a good bit, but the problem is we are trading off availability for disk usage and taking the hit during restart.

I am thinking it may be better to do a checkpoint of the feeList when we do gc, the cleanup phase, and accept that information on restart. 

If the restart is unclean, we remember that and do a freeList recovery when we next do an orderly shutdown. In that way, we can still restart fast, lose some disk space to some missed free pages and gracefully recover when we are stopping.

;;;","17/Oct/18 14:24;jgenender;Nice [~gtully].  I pushed this to 5.15.x (5.15.7) as this was supposed to be in the 5.15 line as well.  Probably should have been a new improvement JIRA.  Updated the versions above as well.  Thank you!;;;","17/Oct/18 16:42;cshannon;Nice catch [~gtully] , I agree that it is fine to temporarily take the space hit as it will get cleaned up on the next clean shutdown.

My only question is will there now be a large delay on shutdown instead? So are we just moving the 2 minute lag time to having to wait on shutdown instead of startup? In that case it doesn’t seem to be much different on a restart case as you have to wait the 2 minutes either way;;;","17/Oct/18 16:48;jgenender;[~cshannon], I think the criticality of this is restart on a failed broker.  It could cause slowness in failover that delays startup of the broker.  In a clean shut down, yes the delay moved to the back, but its a known delay when you are shutting it down in a clean fashion.  Thus you can plan it.  This makes sense as during a failover, you likely need availability immediately since that generally is not planned.;;;","17/Oct/18 17:06;cshannon;[~jgenender] , ah yeah that makes sense, on the failover case on a shared store you want to resume as fast as possible 

So yeah for sure this is a good change as it helps that failover case and then you can plan later when to take that hit on a clean restart or shutdown.;;;","17/Oct/18 17:07;gtully;[~cshannon] sure, the recovery penalty needs to be taken at some stage.

The ~2mins is not ideal, AMQ-7055  helps, but also for the really large index cases, being able to set the index page size may help. That is currently not exposed in kahadb and defaults to 4k, which means loads of small seek/reads of the index file. Exposing that may help.

 ;;;","18/Oct/18 05:30;alanprot;Hum....

I dont really think that this is solving the all problem.... Of course in the case of a crash (unclean shutdown) the fail over will be faster....

But after that, let's imagine that we wanna do a normal restart. Well the broker will have a long shutdown and while doing that it will still hold the lock making the failover slow the same way.

And maybe now is worst... Imagine that the shutdown is taking 2 minutes and the ACTIVEMQ_KILL_MAXSECONDS is set to 30 secs...

In this case all the shutdown will be unclean (so lots of dangling free pages - larger index file on each restart) until we delete the index file and perform a full recovery.

Why don't we save the free page in every checkpoint + keep track of it's hash or fingerPrint (SequenceSetHash) in the metadata (the page size is already saved there).

[https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/5d3a3fcca7fbc04e60a146e42fb1f65b94e4ea7b/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/disk/page/PageFile.java#L468]

Now, in the load method, we can check if the fingerprint of the metadata is equal to the saved free list... if it's equal we can load this list, if it's not, we can recover it (read the whole index file as before).

So in each checkpoint we should:

Calculate freeList hash (or this can be pre calculated changing it every time that this list is modified) 
 Save the free list 
 Save this information in the metadata

Now, on the load we can check if the hash of the loaded free list is the equal to the metadata... if it is we are good.

This is a rough draft of what I meant and seems to be working.

[https://github.com/alanprot/activemq/commit/18036ef7214ef0eaa25c8650f40644dd8b4632a5]

Is important to note that in the Pagefile#load method we need to rebuild the index in the same way it was in the checkpoint (the recovery will be performed after to replay the time btw the checkpoint and the crash)

So...

Imagine the timeline:

T0 -> P1, P2 and P3 are free.

T1 -> Checkpoint

T2 -> P1 got occupied.

T3 -> Crash

In the current scenario after the  Pagefile#load the P1 will be free and then the replay will mark P1 as occupied...

My change only make sure that db.data and db.free are in sync and showing the reality in T1 (checkpoint), If they are in sync i can use the db.free.

 In this case we will only perform a full read if the crash is btw saving the db.free and db.data... This is very unlikely 

[~gtully] [~jgenender] [~cshannon] Does this make sense?

If you think that this makes sense i can create a Jira to try to implement this..

May I suggest that you open a new Jira to track this since this one is resolved.  Right now parts of this are in multiple releases, so its own Jira may help ensure we know what release it would be a part of.   Your code looks pretty clear and I think it deserves its own JIRA  Please reference this one in the new JIRA.;;;","18/Oct/18 13:37;jgenender;One more small comment, I would change from using Random as the fingerprint and perhaps use a time stamp or something.  The Random could potentially have a clash and possibly could have a collision which would cause corruption.  Perhaps use a Time function or time based UUID as your finger print.  Since this will not be doing 2 checkpoints in under a millisecond, I think that would be the safest.;;;","18/Oct/18 14:05;alanprot;Yep...

Or we can change the fingerprint for freePageTxId or something like that and be a single increment (freePageTxId++) on every time i save db.free;;;","18/Oct/18 15:20;jgenender;Also, add a unit test.  The unit test can show a normal checkpoint, and you can also exercise the failure by force calling brokerService.getPersistenceAdapter().checkpoint() and then changing the db.data or db.free fingerprint with some file I/O using the File object, then restarting and testing that it did a full recovery.  Should be straight forward.

When {{TopicSubscription#removeExpiredMessages}} detects an expired message, it will remove it but will increment the counter of dispatched messages as well.

In the worst case scenario slow consumers will no longer receive messages because they are ""full"" when in fact they have nothing to process.

Am I correct in concluding that expired messages must not count towards the dispatched value?

Initial response from activemq insiders was that this was a supported action, but while examining the Journal source, i stumbled on code which would seem to indicate that it isn't handled correctly

Source thread: http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Can-you-change-the-kahadb-journal-file-size-between-broker-starts-td4721155.html#a4721252

Potential problem areas (from forum post):

https://fisheye.apache.org/browse/activemq-6/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/disk/journal/Journal.java?hb=true#to310

This is the startup code.  it attempts to adjust the total length by shaving off an unused portion of the final data file.  if you have made the maxFileLength smaller since the last run, and you have actual data in the last journal file which is _after_ the new maxFileLength, then this computation will incorrectly return a negative value.  my suspicion is that the length of the last data file should be used here instead of maxFileLength.

https://fisheye.apache.org/browse/activemq-6/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/disk/journal/Journal.java?hb=true#to867

likewise, this code attempts to handle adjustments to maxFileLength since the journal file was created, but i think it again fails.  if the maxFileLength has been increased since the data file was created, this would seem to be setting an offset which is past the length of the current data file.  again, it seems like the length of the data file should be used directly.

in general, in order for this to work correctly, the maxFileLength should only be used for code which is creating new files.  all the other code should be solely relying on the size of the existing file, right?

In the first case, as suggested, the last data file length needs to be used or the totalLength reported by the Journal will be wrong as the wrong value is used when computing the unused space.  In the second case (where the journal file grows) it is ok because if the detected length is less than the offset value the journal will reset the cursor to the next file and the correct starting value here: https://fisheye.apache.org/browse/~tag=activemq-5.14.3/activemq-6/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/disk/journal/Journal.java?hb=true#to843

I'm not entirely sure when 5.14.4 will be released (I guess when we determine there is enough bugs fixed) but if you update to 5.14.3 now then the update to 5.14.4 later would be pretty easy.  

This bug has existed for a long time and is not new so I wouldn't necessarily hold off upgrading.  The affects version should probably be updated to show that it actually goes back quite a while.  I just listed the latest version but I believe this issue goes back several versions.;;;","17/Jan/17 08:18;xabhi;I see that the code that you fixed is present in v5.11.1. Can you explain a little more on how this bug will manifest  - like do we see sockets in close_wait state? what is the behavior when this bug happens?;;;","17/Jan/17 12:06;cshannon;The sockets will stay in established state if they stay open.  The issue occurs if a new connection from a client fails for a reason other than a security reason (such as invalid clientId) and then the client doesn't close the socket on their end.  So if the client calls close() on their connection after they get an error or if they shutdown the JVM then the socket would close and it would be fine.  As far as the behavior, you just end up with a bunch of open sockets that won't be closed.  This of course is bad as you can run out of file descriptors, etc.

If you want to see the behavior in action take a look at the unit test I committed: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=blob;f=activemq-unit-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/tcp/TcpTransportCloseSocketTest.java;h=ad2080beaea2a21c24a37003cbab6c7a63344aa1;hb=df7aa6e

This test shows that after the fix there is only 1 socket open instead of 2 because the second connection attempt fails.  If you run this test against an older version such as 5.14.3 then there will be 2 sockets open even though the second connection attempt failed with an InvalidClientIDException because both the broker and client didn't close the socket.;;;","14/Mar/17 11:59;jira-bot;Commit 36689beff755fd6391c3a8291d1e89fc782eac0d in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6561] fix up unit test that expects socket to remain open after InvalidClientIDException, dubious expectation in the test that wants to verify broker is ok
;;;","22/Feb/21 13:52;nauman.hameed@enghouse.com; I am facing a similar issue using ActiveMQ 5.13.2. I have 2 ActiveMQ nodes where one acts as publisher and other is subscriber. Subscriber is attempting to make a connection with publisher after publisher re-start but it is failing with error mentioned in this case.

Let's consider following simple broker network, where machine A connects to machine B...

Machine A config:
{code}
<networkConnector duplex=""true"" uri=""static:(http://machineB:61617)"" name=""bridgeToB"" />
{code}

Machine B config:
{code}
<transportConnector name=""http"" uri=""http://0.0.0.0:61617?maximumConnections=1000&wireFormat.maxFrameSize=104857600""/>
{code}

When ActiveMQ on machine A is restarted, then the connection to machine B is successfully re-established after restart, but after 30 seconds, when keep-alive mechanism sends a HTTP GET request on machine B, then this fails with some java.io.IOException. Then the connection breaks up. It's established new connection to machine B and after 30 seconds again fails the keep-alive GET request. And so on over and over till ActiveMQ on machine B is restarted.

The impact is that warn logging has to be turned off which is not ideal. Looking in detail it seems this is caused by a couple of things. Firstly the Topic start method can be invoked twice, once when adding the destination to the RegionBroker and second when the regionBroker is started. 

That causes the same expireMessagesTask to get scheduled twice which reveals the crux of the problem. The Scheduler allows the same task to be scheduled again in new TimerTasks, even though it will use the same key and ophan any existing (and running) TimerTasks. This is what's happening here. When the topic gets stopped, the orphaned tasks continue to run causing these spurious warnings that clog up the logs.

My suggestion would be for the scheduler to check if the task has already been registered using a putIfAbsent and fail if it already exists:

The issue is that most of the time dataFileIdLock is acquired first and then currentDataFile.  However, when calling the getCurrentDataFile() method if a rotation is needed then the currentDataFile lock is acquired before dataFileIdLock leading to a potential deadlock situation.

The reason for this problem seems to be that the xsd can not be found. So I assume we lack the correct mapping from urls to embedded xsds.

I will work on a fix.

    [AMQ-6544] Create spring.schemas with schemas of activemq and spring

    As spring is embedded now we also need to define the spring schema mappings to make them available when being offline. Downside is that this needs to be maintained. So the better way would be to join the files from activemq-spring and spring. 
    Does anyone know how to do this?

It is hard to reproduce and only occurs on brokers under high load in my testing.

I have finally tracked down the issue to the InnerFutureTask inside of KahaDB that gets used to fire the PendingMarshalUsageTracker on completion.  This task is not thread safe and causes the following 2 problems:
    
    1) Sometimes the listener is never fired and the usage isn't decremented. This case seems to be caused by the listener not being visible to the thread when run.  (volatile or atomic reference need to be used)
    
    2) Sometimes the listener can run twice. This seems to be because of a lack of synchronization between the if(isDone()) check and the done() method call.  This can also be fixed by using an atomic reference.

Yes it is difficult to test right now because our broker pulls in only Jetty 9.2.x.  So our tests just run against 9.2.x as that is the main version supported in 5.14.x.  In 5.15.x I am planning to upgrade to 9.3 so that will get all the tests run against it then.  

To run tests against both 9.2 and 9.3 we'd probably need to create another subproject and override the Jetty dependency to be 9.3 and re-run the Http tests.

I had a few customers getting uncertain about this section that I really think we need to correct this. 

While the first general part is correct:

{quote}
Consuming messages from a pool of consumers an be problematic due to prefetch. Unconsumed prefetched messages are only released when a consumer is closed, but with a pooled consumer the close is deferred (for reuse) till the consumer pool closes. This leaves prefetched messages unconsumed till the consumer is reused. This feature can be desirable from a performance perspective. However, it can lead to out-of-order message delivery when there is more than one consumer in the pool. For this reason, the org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory does not pool consumers.
{quote}

the latter part is wrong:

{quote}
The problem is visible with the Spring DMLC when the cache level is set to CACHE_CONSUMER and there are multiple concurrent consumers. One solution to this problem is to use a prefetch of 0 for a pooled consumer, in this way, it will poll for messages on each call to receive(timeout). Another option is to enable the AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy on the broker to disconnect consumers that have not acknowledged a Message after some configurable time period.
{quote}

Springs DMLC does not pool consumers in the sense that it uses its own pool of JMS consumers for which it grabs an instance when consuming the next message. If it did work that way, then it would fall under the above category and then it would be a problem.
However Spring DMLC caches the consumer, i.e. it re-uses the same JMS consumer object to receive all messages for the life time of the DMLC instance. So it behaves pretty much like properly hand written JMS code, where you create the JMS connection, session, consumer and then use this consumer instance to receive all your messages.
If you run Spring DMLC with multiple consumer threads, then each consumer thread creates its own JMS consumer instances and uses that to process messages. These JMS consumer instances are not mixed between threads. 
So there is no problem with prefetching messages to these consumers, since they are never placed into a pool of some sort.

On the contrary Springs CachingConnectionFactory allows to pool consumers (although off by default) and that kind of pooling of consumers would cause the problems outlined in the general section.

It cannot be used with XA transactions but works fine with local JMS transactions and non-transacted consumers. 
The reason is that without caching the consumer in Spring, it needs to re-create a new consumer for every single message it wants to consume.
The call to session.createConsumer() is a synchronous call against the broker, hence slows down your overall processing performance in the client. 

;;;","25/Nov/16 13:04;tmielke;Here is my suggestion to fix the docs.
I would like to leave the first general part as it is atm, since it is correct.

{quote}

Then re-write the second part to 

{quote}
Pooling consumers is supported by Springs CachingConnectionFactory (although turned off by default). In case you use the CachingConnectionFactory with multiple consumer threads configured in Springs DefaultMessageListenerContainer (DMLC) you either want to turn off consumer pooling in the  CachingConnectionFactory (its off by default) or you may want to use a prefetch of 0 when pooling consumers. In this way, the consumer will poll for messages on each call to receive(timeout). Its generally recommended to turn off consumer caching in Springs CachingConnectionFactory and any other frameworks that allow to pool JMS consumers.

Note that Springs DefaultMessageListenerContainer (DMLC) and its CACHE_CONSUMER cache level is not affected by this problem! Springs DMLC does not pool consumers in the sense that it does not use an internal pool with multiple consumer instances. Instead it caches the consumer, i.e. it re-uses the same JMS consumer object to receive all messages for the life time of the DMLC instance. So it behaves pretty much like properly hand written JMS code, where you create the JMS connection, session, consumer and then use this consumer instance to receive all your messages.
Hence there is no problem with using CACHE_CONSUMER in Spring DMLC, even with multiple consumer threads, unless you are using XA transactions. XA transactions do not work with CACHE_CONSUMER in Spring DMLC. However local JMS transactions and non-transacted consumers are just fine to use CACHE_CONSUMER in Springs DMLC.

Also note that Camel's JMS or ActiveMQ components use Springs DMLC internally. So everything said above about Springs DMLC and CACHE_CONSUMER applies to these two Camel components as well.

guava 14 was the culprit - activemq-osgi does not need to import javax.inject

Specific settings :
- No prefetch sizes are set in a policyEntry of the activemq.xml.
- No prefetch sizes are set in the brokerURL in the client code.

We get the following situation (subscriber info) at the moment a subscriber
connects with the Qpid client.
The Inflight value becomes -1000 what is very strange.

Pending Queue Size  | Inflight | Enqueued | Dequeued | Prefetch
0                                | -1000  | 0               | 0                | 0

We get the following situation when one topic message is published.
The Inflight value increased with 2.

Pending Queue Size  | Inflight | Enqueued | Dequeued | Prefetch
0                                | -998    | 1                | 1               | 0

We get the following situation when 500 topic messages are published.
The Inflight value is now 0 and the 500 messages are consumed.

Pending Queue Size  | Inflight | Enqueued | Dequeued | Prefetch
0                                | 0         | 500            | 500           | 0

At the moment message 501 is published increases the ""Pending Queue Size"" and the messages ""Enqueued"" as well. The ""Dequeued"" messages remains 500 and message 501 can't be consumed by the subscriber !

Pending Queue Size  | Inflight | Enqueued | Dequeued | Prefetch
1                                | 0          | 501          | 500            | 0

I can tell you that the problem is started in ActiveMQ 5.14.1.

Below you can see the difference between ActiveMQ 5.14.0 and ActiveMQ 5.14.1 at the moment a subscriber connects, before a message is consumed.

    AMQ-6494 Process SHUTDOWN_INFO and REMOVE_INFO to avoid timeouts

----
;;;","02/Nov/16 16:04;hadrian;This issue is visible in tests such as DestinationBridgeAccessorsTest.

During shutdown, in BrokerService around line 2208 where JmsConnectors are stopped a few SHUTDOWN_INFO and REMOVE_INFO messages are sent. However, the transport listener in TransportConnection, checks for !brokerService.isStopping() (around line 192) and ignores and skips processing of those messages during shutdown. This causes the exceptions and 15 sec timeouts.

The PR above solves the problem. I didn't commit it just yet giving it a bit of time for review, if anybody could think of any edge case that could cause problems.

Ignoring test that currently fails. The parent test is already ignored

The test itself is the issue and needs to be fixed as it is failing on errors that are now expected so I went ahead and ignored the test for now.  It's just failing for level db as the parent test that runs on KahaDB has already been ignored.;;;","22/Feb/17 14:08;gtully;There are a few tests in the activemq.all set that fail (65+ runs) with this change. 
I peeked at one, org.apache.activemq.bugs.AMQ2149Test and the failure results in a brokerstopped jms exception bubbling up to the client with the changes. Without the changes the IOException from a disconnect is being handled under the covers by failover: which does a resend.

The fix is to have the app handle that JMS exception which is really a behaviour change. I wonder if there is some middle ground here that will solve the original problem but not change the behaviour and keep those existing failover tests working?
Fixing the test is accepting this new behaviour which may come as a surprise to existing users.

This occurs because no default servlet is defined.

I'm not really sure what the best behavior is here. On one hand we could either return nothing for a response to a GET request (or register the default servlet and forward to it).  Or we could just have the WebSocket servlet not implement GET at all and throw an error because there's not really a good reason to make a GET request to the WebSocket servlet that I can think of.

My preference would probably be to just return an empty response if a GET request was made and no error.;;;","15/Nov/16 15:57;neilgreatorex;What I am attempting to do is use client certificates in order to authenticate connections from the web browser (Chrome in this case) to ActiveMQ. I've found that in order to get Chrome to pop up the box to allow the user to choose their client certificate, I need to first make a standard HTTPS request to the WSS endpoint. Once the user has chosen to present their certificate to this connection, the WebSocket connection will also present their certificate enabling the use of it for authentication. It could be argued that this is a ""feature"" in Chrome, but I equally think that passing the request on to the non-existent default servlet is not ideal.

My first preference would be to make it possible to define (somehow) a default servlet for the WebSocket servlet to pass the request onto. Failing that, I would prefer receiving an empty response over not implementing GET at all.;;;","17/Nov/16 14:06;Sp4rKy;Hi, just a comment as we also get this issue.

We have a lot of websocket (wss) connections from various customers , mobile or desktop, over mobile network or not etc etc ... We have ~ 7k connections , with a lot of connections dropping and initializing all the time (basically this is connected to a website , so every time a user switches to a new page => new connection). 

in the 20 minutes, I find not less than 350 NPE with the exact same stacktrace. If I check the ""qtpXXXXX"" id at the beginning of log line and grep for it, I usually find other lines like :

bq. User Agent: [unset] requested WebSocket version [-1], Jetty supports version: [13] | org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.WebSocketServerFactory

and the corresponding IP are likly to be behind some enterprise proxy that (I guess) doesn't support websocket. 
Also, most of the qtpXXX id don't have any log with the source IP. It would be good to have the source IP when an exception is raised.
;;;","17/Nov/16 14:22;cshannon;I think the simplest thing to do is just return an empty response (no exception).

However, even if the traffic dropped in the night, the thread count never decreased and is still ~ 2500.

I checked a thread dump and it looks like (full dump attached) :

They are created every time a user log in to the website (or throug mobile app) or switch to a new page while being logged in. 

Something (maybe) interesting is that we had a bug in our code which was creating too many topics (~ 100k in a few seconds) by sending messages to lot of these new topics. 95% of them were never read. We fixed it and reduced to ~ 8000 topics (no GC of old destination right now), but the thread leak is still present and seems to grow at same speed than before (from ~ 300 right after start to ~ 1000 in 3 hours), so looks like this is not related to topics/messages. So the only remaining possibility is client side.  Moreover, looking at the graph, it seems that the number of thread increases by ""step"". For ex between 7.50 and 8.10 pm (utc+2) it only increase of 100threads,  then in 15 minutes I have a 500 thread bump, then almost stable for 10 minutes, then +400 threads in 5 minutes etc ... It seems that the number of threads increases faster when I have a lot of ""outgoing messages"", and slowly when I don't have much, maybe a hint.

There seems to me to be 2 issues here:

1) Jetty seems to have an issue where it gets stuck and never returns or times out the blocking send.  I found this issue here: https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/272
2) The inactivity monitor is supposed to be doing a one way send anyways but the send is actually a blocking send so it can get stuck waiting for a response. 

I think under the old Jetty 8 websocket stuff we were doing async sends but under Jetty 9 that got switched to sync and it waits for the bytes to transfer.  I think, at least for the inactivity monitor and maybe all calls, we should be doing async sends and not blocking so that the lock can be released.  Or at least have some way to timeout.

[~tabish121], what do you think about something like this? https://github.com/cshannon/activemq/commit/915cc828b928268e18bb50b99247e78e77aa0d51;;;","03/Nov/16 20:26;tabish;Seems reasonable that these calls shouldn't block but we need to at least try and throw an error if the send can't complete to break the connection, so maybe something like:

However, even setting this flag, I am still seeing some brokers run out of memory.  After analyzing the heap dumps I have found 2 reasons for this:

1) Non-persistent messages do not have their unmarshalled state cleared.  This was done because when a message is persisted it is guaranteed to have the marshalled state.  However we can still clear the memory for non-persistent messages as long as we check to make sure the marshalled state exists first, which it will for transports like TCP but won't exist for the VM transport.

2) When a message is added to a subscription the properties are needed to check which subscription messages can be dispatched to.  This causes the memory to be unmarshalled again.  

In the topic case, we should probably defer the clearing of the state until after the message is added to a subscription because messages are immediately dispatched to topic subs so we don't unnecessarily have to convert the data twice.  In the queue case it probably makes sense to clear memory on add to the queue and on add to the subscription.",,cshannon,gtully,jira-bot,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Tue Nov 01 14:32:10 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i35auf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"24/Oct/16 14:06;cshannon;[~gtully],

Mind taking a quick look at this patch I created?  I haven't written tests yet but this should give you an idea the direction I am going with this and I wanted to see if you thought I was overlooking anything.

https://github.com/cshannon/activemq/commit/85efac7c2f5d95a8ae75f8daa4a9478186d25d31;;;","24/Oct/16 15:00;gtully;[~cshannon] looks good 


one thought: 
I guess it also means that on each dispatch, so when prefetched messages are redelivered, there will be an unmarshall/clear.
it makes me think that maybe doing something to ensure that properties in both states are part of the size. That would tackle directly the OOM.

However the non persistent case is valid and I guess the selector case is less common.

One important aspect is ensuring no sharing of a message when the destructive change to clear the state is made. With composite sends or virtual topics (mostly there is copy) but some care there may be needed. Also consumer that use a composite dest to subscribe to multiple dests. Recall the test that had us add/remove some sync in message in the past.

I think it will be fine, just be sure there is some existing sync point that will protect you in the case of sharing.
;;;","24/Oct/16 15:20;cshannon;That's a good point about not sharing the message while doing the clearing which I think could be an issue with topic subscriptions since the message will potentially be passed to multiple subs.

When doing the clear in the subscriptions maybe we need to do something like add a synchronize around the clear block:

{noformat}
if (isReduceMemoryFootprint()) {
  synchronized(node) {
    if (node.getMessage().isMarshalled()) {
      node.getMessage().clearUnMarshalledState();
    }
}
{noformat}

Ultimately, I agree about having the size count both states.  That would protect form OOM errors for when the message contains both of the states while also trying to save memory when it can.  The hard part is trying to estimate the size of the properties map.;;;","24/Oct/16 15:54;cshannon;May not need the sync after all since the dispatch happens in the same thread sequentially (the dispatch policy just iterates over each subscription 1 at a time)

Also, really it needs to clear out only after it finishes dispatching to all subscriptions that match.  Otherwise it will clear the memory and then the next call to matches() for the next consume there will be another unmarshal.

So I think I might need to think about this a little bit more to see if/where it makes sense to do this in the subscription.  At the very least we can make the change for non-persistent messages to start.;;;","25/Oct/16 13:34;cshannon;[~gtully],  I've decided to be slightly more conservative for this patch.  I don't feel super comfortable putting the memory clearing into the add method of the subscription like I did in my original patch because we would get into a state where we have to unmarshall/marshal the properties over and over again for each sub if there is a selector.  Plus there could be race condition issues at that point since the message has now been handed off to the different subscriptions.  So the new plan is to:

1) Still handle clearing the memory for non-persistent messages by checking if content and marshalledProperties are not null (or if both marshalledProperties and properties are null)
2) For topics, move the clear memory method call from doMessageSend to the dispatch method and put it after the subscriptionRecoveryPolicy check (which needs to use the properties and triggers and unmarshal) but before the dispatch itself.

This will at least fix non-persistent messages and it will also clear memory for topic subscriptions as long as there are no selectors (which is a less common case).  For the selector case where the dispatch policy triggers an unmarshall I would need to think about it a bit more or maybe we'd just need to do something like you mentioned earlier where we actually count the size of both objects in memory.;;;","25/Oct/16 14:19;jira-bot;Commit 7c3bb401007b4047c540287b53b435b20d3161c0 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

The exception isn't handled, and ends up both creating an empty journal file and, more importantly, leaking a file descriptor.

ActiveMQ eventually runs out of file descriptors and crashes.

In addition to handling this condition, perhaps the default ACTIVEMQ_OPTS_MEMORY settings should configure enough direct memory to allow some multiple of log files to be created near simultaneously, or at least this possibility documented in the KahaDB settings.

Since none of the developers have anything near that size of disk space to test on you will probably have to do some more debugging on your end to see what the problem is.  The code where the limits are checked is here: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/BrokerService.java#L2044

You could try setting up a remote debugger and some break points to see where the value is going bad.  The other option is you can add some logging statements to the code and rebuild it, etc. and deploy the rebuilt version.;;;","23/Sep/16 17:24;william.crowell;I have a theory that a long is not large enough to represent 8,796,093,022,208 megabytes, and we are running into an overflow issue.

Given that a long primitive type in Java 7 has a range of -2 to the 63rd power and a maximum value of 2 to the 63rd power -1.

This means that a long can have values -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

If I convert 8796093022208 megabytes into bytes then that value is 9,223,372,036,854,780,000 which is 4,193 outside the maximum value of a long.

If you happen to be running Java 8, then a unsigned 64-bit long can have a maximum value of 18,446,744,073,709,500,000 which would be large enough.

This means that the call to Java's java.io.File.getTotalSpace() would overflow since it returns a long: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#getTotalSpace()

In Java 8, this probably works fine.  Could I propose changing the variable on line 2050 of org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService to a double instead of a long?

...
double totalSpace = dir.getTotalSpace();
...

But I don't see how changing totalSpace to a double would do anything.  java.io.File.getTotalSpace() would still overflow and return a negative long value which would then just become a negative double.;;;","23/Sep/16 18:02;william.crowell;Unfortunately, I think you are right.

One option would be to explicitly work around this particular use case, by assuming that if the long we get back from getTotalSpace() is negative, that means the filesystem is plenty big enough to hold the broker's data files.  Obviously you can construct cases where the overflow will result in a small positive number and we'll still give the wrong answer, but the hack would still cover anyone with an 8EB filesystem (including the reporter of this bug).  16 EB or any multiple thereof, however, would be a problem.

Another option would be to provide a config flag that allows you to skip the filesystem free space check, eliminating the problem entirely for all filesystem sizes when the flag is used.  We should do this at a minimum, whether or not we try to do hacks based on negative return values from getTotalSpace().;;;","27/Sep/16 13:01;william.crowell;I agree with Tim.

If you take a look at the unit test project you'll see a ton of examples of tests and how to configure a BrokerService to start a real broker in JUnit.

;;;","29/Sep/16 12:48;tbain98;This approach addresses the immediate problem, with an 8 EB volume.  It will do nothing for a 16EB volume, a 32 EB volume, or any other multiple of 16 EB, because those volumes will all show as small positively-sized volumes.  (If 8EB is 4193 bytes over half the range of a long, double that - 16 EB - will be 4193 * 2 = 8386 bytes over the full range of a long, and will mod down to the small but positive remainder: 8386 bytes.  And multiplying that number by anything will result in a volume that is 8386 bytes times the multiplier, which will probably be smaller than the KahaDB store.)  So the proposed (and implemented) algorithm fixes today's problem, but does nothing for the next problem.

The only safe way to allow people to not be bit by this in the future is to implement the flag.  It would be defaulted to false, and enabled only when they deem it necessary based on their own knowledge of their storage situation.  People don't go changing values randomly, so no one's going to make the change unless they believe they need it, and if they know about the setting to misconfigure it, they'll know what to set back when it causes them problems.

Based on the above, I recommend rejecting the pull request that was just made, and reworking the change to include a flag.  Otherwise, we're going to get to do this all over again whenever Amazon increases the default EFS volume size to 16EB.;;;","29/Sep/16 12:49;tbain98;I recommend rejecting this pull request, and reworking the change to include a flag.

If we introduce the flag and set it to true and totalSpace is negative, then would that not have other consequences (e.g. looking strange in the JMX and web consoles and other issues)?;;;","29/Sep/16 13:59;cshannon;I would probably do a combination of the two things.

First, as Tim said, I would implement a flag (defaulting to false) that can be turned on that would disable the usage check altogether.  Also note that there is a task that gets scheduled to periodically check the usage and this flag should also make sure this task is not scheduled.

Second, as a sanity check, I see no harm in also adding a check for a negative value of totalSpace.  If the value is negative then I would think the safest thing to do is to throw an exception with a good error message that explains why the error most likely happened (probably an overflow) and how to fix it (enable the new flag to true to disable the check).  You could also just allow the broker to start up with the negative value and skip the check but I would think it's better to error to make sure the user is aware of the issue and can explicitly decide if they want to disable the check or use a smaller partition.;;;","29/Nov/16 18:06;davsclaus;Is anyone working on implementing the last suggestions from Christopher about that flag to turn on | off.;;;","29/Nov/16 18:13;cshannon;I don't think anything has been done since the original PR.

The typical use case is to limit the brokers disk usage through flow control or blocking. 
In the case where the broker does not have exclusive access to a disk partition, or in the case of the partition giving bad information, it is useful to be able to specify the expected hard limit.

I am thinking that an StoreUsage.setTotalSpace(long v) option will suffice. Any value > 0 will be taken as the total available space and the filesystem will not be queried further.
Any limit will then be relative to the actual store usage (index and journal data files) as a portion of the totalSpace value. Irrespective of what the actual file system reports.
This feature then allows a user to partition a shared disk between brokers.
In the EFS case, it allows the user to specify the value of disk space that is to be used by the broker.

Then I found it's a bug(AMQ-5016) in activemq5.9.0 , so I download the activemq5.14.0. I run the BitArrayBinTest.java:

{code}
 public static void main(String[] args) {
       BitArrayBin toTest = new BitArrayBin(1024);
       long largeNum = Integer.MAX_VALUE*2L +100L;
       toTest.setBit(largeNum, true);
       System.out.println(toTest.getBit(largeNum));   
}
{code}

 I expect the results to be ""true"",but the result of running the above code is ""false"". 
I debug the code,and I  found a method 'getBin(long index)' in class BitArrayBin. Code as follows:

{code}
private int getBin(long index) {
        int answer = 0;
        if (longFirstIndex < 0) {
            longFirstIndex = (int) (index - (index % BitArray.LONG_SIZE));
        } else if (longFirstIndex >= 0) {
            answer = (int)((index - longFirstIndex) / BitArray.LONG_SIZE);
        }
        return answer;
    }
{code}

 I think the problem is in  code ‘longFirstIndex = (int) (index - (index % BitArray.LONG_SIZE))‘.  When  index is larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE, longFirstIndex will be negative.  I think this line of code should be modified to  ‘longFirstIndex = (long) (index - (index % BitArray.LONG_SIZE));’

;;;","16/Sep/16 08:37;dbonn;Successfully tried to reproduce this Issue using ActiveMQ 5.13.3
;;;","21/Sep/16 12:25;cshannon;I took a look at this and there are actually two problems here with how noLocal is handled with durables.  The main issue you are seeing is that when the durable comes back online the new connectionId is not being captured for the NoLocal expression parser which means that when messages are sent after broker restart the logic thinks that the message isn't coming from the current subscription when it is.  The fix here is to make sure the connectionId is updated properly when the new consumer comes online.

The second issue is that the JMS spec says that 
{noformat}
A client can change an existing durable subscription by creating a durable
TopicSubscriber with the same name and a new topic and/or message selector,
or NoLocal attribute. Changing a durable subscription is equivalent to deleting
and recreating it.
{noformat}

Right now we aren't checking if that NoLocal attribute changes at all when a new consumer comes online.  Based on the spec I think we should update the activation check such that if the NoLocal attribute changes (ie goes from false to true or true to false) we treat it as a selector change and process it the same way (delete and recreate the sub)

I am working on a patch and fix now to go out with our 5.14.1 release.;;;","21/Sep/16 12:49;cshannon;Looks like there are two places where the NoLocal attribute needs to be checked, it is done in one location but not the other.;;;","21/Sep/16 13:35;jira-bot;Commit 7c293b661f22245ce21bf2b5aa1c5bf4192cb8c5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

This behavior is most evident when using the auto+nio+ssl transport for a network bridge between 2 brokers, however I also saw the issue for the normal nio+ssl transport when running the NetworkAsyncStartTest and even the amqp+nio+ssl transport.

After debugging I found that the issue is that the onSelect method of the registered callback, which calls the serviceRead() method, is not always getting triggered.  I believe that the root of the problem is that even though a selector is registered with a SelectionKey.OP_READ, there is no guarantee that the selected set is correct which is what the SelectorWorker uses to detect if the operation is ready. The SelectionKey documentation specifically states that the ready set is a hint but not a guarantee that the channel is ready.  This seems to only effect the SSL transport (not normal NIO), probably because a read selection was already done once to unwrap the SSL transport

More info: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectionKey.html

The fix for this is to trigger the selectRead() after the transport finishes starting up.  (needs to be in a new thread specifically for OpenWire to allow the wireformat negotiation to not block on startup).  This will work for the SSL transport specifically since we know the transport is read to read from the the channel after starting up.  We know this because the SSL handshake already took place which means we've already read from the channel.

[AMQ-6414] additional test that reproduces and validates
;;;","27/Feb/17 16:52;gtully;I was digging into this fix from another angle, hence the additional test.
The issue is that doing the ssl handshake reads the first openwire command, so there is some remaining data to read once the handshake completes. wireformat negotiation times out and the brokerInfo never gets sent and it hangs.

The async read in a different thread can be conditional on:
{code} if (inputBuffer.position() > 0 && inputBuffer.hasRemaining() && wireFormat instanceof OpenWireFormat) {code} however doing a blocking read is also fine for openwire because of the negotiation that will follow.
Turns out there is similar logic in mqtt and stomp (without the sync around negotiation): https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/da9fedead4078cc82efb32e15d8d9cd53c8e82dc/activemq-mqtt/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/mqtt/MQTTNIOSSLTransport.java#L53

As an aside, the blocking around openwire negotiation relates to the need to send each sides preferred options with default format so that it will be properly marshalled/unmarshalled *before* options are applied.

[AMQ-6414] additional logging that helped identify root cause
;;;","27/Feb/17 17:24;cshannon;[~gtully], thanks for digging deeper into this to see the root cause.  I had primarily noticed it with the auto+nio+ssl transport but then saw it happen in other cases which is when I discovered the need to trigger an extra read to finish reading the bytes.

I still think the async start is needed when using auto+nio+ssl otherwise it will get stuck.  For example, using NetworkReconnectSslNioTest that you added, If I change the doInit() method in NIOSSLTransport to the following it works fine:

{code:java}
    protected void doInit() throws Exception {
        if (inputBuffer.position() > 0 && inputBuffer.hasRemaining() && wireFormat instanceof OpenWireFormat) {
            taskRunnerFactory.execute(new Runnable() {

                @Override
                public void run() {
                    //Need to start in new thread to let startup finish first
                    //We can trigger a read because we know the channel is ready since the SSL handshake
                    //already happened
                    serviceRead();
                    initialized.countDown();
                }
            });
        } else {
            initialized.countDown();
        }
    }
{code}

However, if I then update your test to use the auto+nio+ssl transport it will no longer work anymore even with the above change at as it needs to be async so the detection doesn't get stuck.

So, we could either leave things the way they currently are now (with the async always scheduled) or update it so that async is only always scheduled for auto+nio+ssl and conditionally for regular nio+ssl transports.;;;","28/Feb/17 11:20;gtully;[~cshannon] I think it is ok as it is now, so long as we don't get a concurrent read which your initialized latch sorts.
If I get a chance to explore the auto scenario we can revisit.;;;","28/Feb/17 13:12;cshannon;[~gtully], sounds good.  I've been running the patch since September and it has been working well.  No more timeout issues on any of the nio+ssl transports and the countdown latch has prevented a concurrent read.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have enabled the JMS message transformer for the AMQP transport connector. If I send a UTF-8 text message over AMQP and then reads it back over AMQP I get an empty message body.

I have looked at the code and found the bad code. It is in the {{org.apache.activemq.transport.amqp.message.ActiveMQJMSVendor}} class.

When the inbound message arrives the {{createTextMessage(String)}} method is called. That method creates an {{ActiveMQTextMessage}} instance whose data is set with the {{setText}} method.

When the outbound message is to be sent the {{getBinaryFromMessageBody(TextMessage)}} method is called. This method tries to get the data with the {{getContent}} method, but that method always returns {{null}}. The {{getText}} method returns the correct data, but is not used here.

Kahadb has an accessor pool of random access files and a periodic cleanup. However the cleanup does not work as expected.
Only on journal gc does the pool get purged.
This issue can arise with very large amounts of journal files that are paging and on recovery when the entire journal needs to be replayed.
In essence, currently there needs to be fd per journal data file.

This is especially strange as some of the projects even include custom maven bundle plugin settings.

The MQTT transport will now throw an exception if a PINGREQ is sent to

The MQTT transport will now throw an exception if a PINGREQ is sent to
the broker if a CONNECT packet has not been received first as the spec
says CONNECT must be the first packet sent.

I looked at this briefly and it seems like in the [onWebSocketClose|https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/activemq-5.13.3/activemq-http/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/ws/jetty9/MQTTSocket.java#L81] method of MQTTSocket we should be checking if a disconnect frame has been received already prior to close and if not then call getProtocolConverter().onTransportError() which should take care of LWT.

;;;","09/Jun/16 12:34;gtully;this is a good patch. thanks.
One quick change. I think you can replace the new dependency on uk.org.lidalia... with the DefaultTestAppender. It is not as neat, but it does work fine and is already used in many tests.
See some example usage at: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/e2b4ca2c59a316be91cf391c758a10e518dd3a1f/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/usage/StoreUsageLimitsTest.java#L55

final picky thing - the formatting on the new code seems different, maybe there are tabs in the mix of something. Just follow what is there so that there are no formatting changes.
;;;","10/Jun/16 07:30;JBastijns;Fixed the formatting.

When I use the DefaultTestAppender I have to add a dependency on activemq-unit-tests test-jar which introduces a cyclic dependency between activemq-unit-tests and activemq-jdbc-store.

However, since the change made in AMQ-6058, it appears that, given the example above, _neither_ queue receives the message.  This is because the change performs a startsWith comparison of the destination against the prefix, rather than a regex comparison.

If there is a reason to prevent leading wildcards in the prefix, it should be documented, otherwise the sanity check in shouldDispatch(...) needs to be updated to handle it.",,cshannon,githubbot,jira-bot,jonathanmalek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Mon Jun 06 13:18:45 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2yzrz:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"05/Jun/16 00:00;githubbot;GitHub user JonathanMalek opened a pull request:

The dequeue counts also seem to be wrong as well.  This is hard to reproduce as it happens rarely, but running a purge while there are consumers online acking seems to be an occasional cause. 

The removeMessage method in a Queue can be called more than once for the same message if an ack comes in at the same time as a purge.  (This is because messages are prefetched so they can be acked even while they are purged) Taking a closer look, the broker handles duplicate calls ok in most cases but there are two areas that need to be fixed.

First, there is a race condition in the dropMessage() method in Queue.  It checks if the message is dropped before continuing with the drop.  This is not thread safe because the two methods calls are not synchronized together. I was able to show negative counts by introducing a small amount of latency between those two calls during a test.  There needs to be some synchronization done here to prevent the counts from getting out of sync.

Second, the dequeue counter needs to be moved out of the removeMessage() method and to the dropMessage() method so it can be protected by the same sync and only incremented when a message is dropped to prevent duplicate counts.

fixing dequeue stats so messages aren't counted twice

Normally this task runs on the same executor as the checkpoint task so the ack compaction task wouldn't run at the same time as the checkpoint task as they are processed one at a time.

However, there are two cases where this isn't always true.  First, the checkpoint() method is public and can be called through the PersistenceAdapter interface by someone at the same time the ack compaction is running.  Second, a checkpoint is called during shutdown without using the executor and could also run while the ack compaction is running.

The main reason for this fix is because when doing some testing I was seeing an occasional error from journal.getNextLocation() in the forwardAllAcks method because a journal file was missing which I believe was cleaned up by the cleanup task.  I was testing scenarios such as shutdown and also manually triggering the task at the same time as an ack compaction.

Also, while we are at it, we should have a try/catch around the journal.getNextLocation calls to catch any IOException so we can abort gracefully.

These messages get dispatched first. However, if these messages are unconsumed again, they get appended to the dispatched list.
This makes sense when there are multiple consumers, A gets 10, B gets 10, A closes, there are 10 to redeliver, B closes, there are now 20 to redeliver. the order should be preserved.
However if there is a single consumer this breaks.

Consider: 
publish 100 to Q
consume 50 and rollback/close with all unacked, expect 0-49
consume 10 and rollback/close with all unacked, expect 0-9
consume 10 more ... expect 0-9 but get 10-19!

In concert with the strictOrderDispatch policy, I think we should be able to support the natural expectation here.

The scenario presents its self with prefetched messages where the prefetch varies or more naturally with a single consumer that consumed in various transaction batches. In the transacted case, two failures would result in compromised queue ordering.

3. restart activemq.  It will fail to start with errors in the log about no available disk space (expected).
4. delete the files created in step 2, so that the drive is not full
5. start activemq again.  This time it will fail with the below exception:

Connection watchdog is started for every initiated connection and stopped on WireFormatInfo command. HTTP transport doesn't send WireFormatInfo so the watchdog never realises that the connection has been successfully established.

The connection gets terminated every 30seconds by the watchdog.
At the beginning, everything looks fine, but then you start getting exceptions and start losing packets. I haven't seen that myself, but I had people reporting that if HTTP transports are in use, it eventually destabilises the broker and affects non-HTTP transports too.

https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/ActiveMQ/job/ActiveMQ-Java8/652/testReport/

We have observed an issue with durable wildcard subscribers where it seems that a durable subscriber restored after a broker restart is not being replaced/updated when the subscriber reconnects after the restart. Instead both the restored and reconnected durable subscribers are being kept by the broker.

An example may help to clarify the issue:

*Before restart*:
Topic: alphabet.a
Durable subscriber: aplhabet.>

*After restart*:
Durable subscriber: alphabet.a

*After reconnect*:
Durable subscriber: aplhabet.a
Durable subscriber: alphabet.>

As messages sent to the topic are forwarded to both the restored and reconnected durable subscriber, but the restored subscriber is never being dequeued it consumes ever increasing amounts of memory.

The issue is related to AMQ-5153 as the restored subscriber has an incorrect subscribed destination (i.e. alhpabet.a instead of alphabet.>). 

However, the restored and reconnected durable subscribers only come into co-existence if the broker is run with broker plugins (i.e. authorization/authentication) as the use of DestinationFilters prevents the TopicRegion from running through all known Topics to remove possible matching subscriptions.",,jira-bot,osmanrafiq,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMQ-5153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"15/Apr/16 22:34;tabish;AMQ6254Test.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12799028/AMQ6254Test.java","15/Apr/16 08:48;osmanrafiq;DurableWildcardSubscriptionReactivationTest.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12798924/DurableWildcardSubscriptionReactivationTest.java",,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Tue Apr 19 13:54:55 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2w627:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"15/Apr/16 08:48;osmanrafiq;Attaching a unit test that shows the existence of another subscription after broker restart.

* The currentState field should be volatile to ensure correct visibility in a multi-threaded environment
* the assignment to the currentState field at the end of the healthList method should only happen once the _final_ string has been built.  the current code could expose a caller to a partially built string (since the field is continually re-assigned as the string is built).

On a separate note, the semantics of this class are non-obvious.  We were monitoring our broker via jmx using the CurrentState attribute for a year or so now and i only just realized that the value is useless.  The value is useless because _it is only updated if you call the healthList() method first_.  The CurrentState attribute is the one someone would most likely monitor using an external automated management product, yet it is not useful by itself.  I would recommend one of the following approaches:
* at the very least, the current behavior should be _clearly documented_ so that users know they have to call one of the other methods first in order to get a valid CurrentState
* Alternately, it would be nice if calling the getCurrentState() by itself were sufficient.  this could be accomplished via one of the following approaches:
** Have the BrokerService schedule a periodic task to invoke the healthList() method in order to ensure that the CurrentState attribute gets updated.
** Track a ""last updated"" field within the HealthView class and have the getCurrentState() method itself invoke the healthList() method first if the currentState is too old.",,jahlborn,jira-bot,tabish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Thu Apr 14 20:56:20 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2w4tj:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"14/Apr/16 20:28;tabish;Since the Broker doesn't know if anyone is even looking at the HealthView bits it wouldn't be optimal to be doing such a heavyweight operation for no good reason which is why there isn't a scheduled task.

Failover - transport connected to one broker fails due to error in connection to another broker,AMQ-6248,12958845,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

The client log contains message:
{{WARN | ActiveMQ Transport: *URI1* \[FailoverTransport] Transport (*URI2*) failed, attempting to automatically reconnect}}

The exact impact on client failover differs with each setup and environment. In our case this forced client to infinitely switch between two available brokers.

Assume client is configured to use broker URL in form
{{failover:(URI1,URI2)?randomize=false}}.
Assume that broker with URI1 is down and the other broker URI2 is running fine. This is normal master/slave setup. 

Client tries to establish connection and the following happens:
1. URI1 is tried, it fails because this broker is not reachable (down or waiting slave)
2. URI2 is tried, it succeeds because this broker is currently the 'master'
3. Exception from thread of transport to URI1 causes failure in transport to URI2
4. Try another transport in the list. Oh wait, its URI1 -> go to 1.

Impact for different configurations might not be that severe. But unfortunately in our case we were not able to avoid this bug no matter the configuration. For example {{randomize=true}} helped a little, but still the inifinite loop happens 1/2 of the time.

The bug is caused by a single shared instance {{myTransportListener}} of {{TransportListener}} in {{FailoverTransport}} class. {{doReconnect()}} tries to start transport to URI1 and registers the listener on it. Transport fails to start and the next transport to URI2 is tried. But the listener is not unregistered from the failed transport URI1. Failures that happen on transport URI1 may call in its own thread the listener method {{onException()}}. This call will get to {{handleTransportFailure()}} where it waits for the {{reconnectMutex}}. The reconnect task thread continues, establishes Transport URI2, sets it to {{connectedTransport}}=URI2, releases the reconnectMutex. The thread of transport URI1 unblocks in handleTransportFailure() and destroys the connectedTransport=URI2.

I have created a patch against version 5.11 that deals specifically with this problem.
The change is that instead of the single shared myTrasnportListener instance there is a new listener created for each new transport.
Each new listener keeps reference to the transport it was assigned to. The listener will cause failover only if the exception is coming from the transport which is currently connected.
I didn't care about the other methods of the listener, but these probably need the same restriction.

This bug is present in all versions from version 4.0 (I didn't go deeper). The idea in the patch should be applicable for all versions.

Test code to reproduce the problem  has also been uploaded to this discussion.

We have  a situation where we have a producer which is feeding a slow consumer.
The consumer belongs to a third party so we do not have control over the broker configuration.
We would like to terminate our producer but we find that we cannot do so. We can set the timeout on the connection and we then trap the timeout exception. The problem is that when we try to close the session it attempts to rollback but cannot do so as the rollback blocks.

We have created a small test that is included in the zip (mentioned above) of an Eclipse project.The zip includes three classes. Call the main method of RunTest to run the test. The activemq.xml used is in the root directory of the project. 

The program will timeout after 51 messages and attempt to close the session. 

It eventually locks in this line: 

            this.connection.syncSendPacket(info); 

in the rollback method of the TransactionContext class.

We believe that the most sensible solution to this is that the rollback should respond to the same timeout as the connection.
","The test was run using an out of the box install of ActiveMQ 5.13.2 on Windows 7 Professional (64 bit).

the transport thread is busy waiting for space, blocked, so the next command, the rollback/close cannot be read from the socket.
Without broker side async blocking, via producerFlowControl or the error on no space, the default behaviour is to block the transport thread.

Because the broker config cannot be changed I think there are two client options:
1) use async send and a small producerWindow, this will cause your client to block pending space on the broker for pending messages. However having peeked at the org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageProducer#send(javax.jms.Destination, javax.jms.Message, int, int, long, org.apache.activemq.AsyncCallback) - there is no timeout limit, so an interrupted exception is all that will stop that wait. not so good.

2) force a close of the connection via the underlying transport, so that the  jms connection sees a socket closure and will report an error. This should avoid the normal closure processing after you see a send timeout.
That is a bit of a hack, using an activemq narrow api. There are some examples of how to do it in the unit tests:
https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/e2b4ca2c59a316be91cf391c758a10e518dd3a1f/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/failover/FailoverTimeoutTest.java#L210
;;;","11/Apr/16 12:48;kenhalldnb;Thanks Gary, I'll test that and see how I get on - I looked at using the socket but didn't know how to access it - I was also unsure of what the consequences of doing this would be.
Our current solution is to interrupt the thread - something like what you suggest in option 1.

Do you think that the fact that there is no mechanism to time out the rollback is a bug? And if so - do you think it is likely to be fixed?

I think it would be nice to be able to set a timeout on the rollback (either by inheriting the timeout from the connection or by setting it explicitly) to cover situations like this. If it was felt that inheritance was a bad idea then an explicit rollback(long timeout) call could be added.;;;","11/Apr/16 13:24;kenhalldnb;Thanks Gary - that worked perfectly. It's an acceptable solution in our situation so I'm happy to close this issue unless you want to keep it open for any reason. 
If it makes sense to you I can raise the option to timeout a rollback as a feature request.;;;","11/Apr/16 13:32;gtully;I am not sure. It is a bit of an anti pattern, the whole send timeout. 
Really the connection should close, because the sync send state is unknown. In this case the transaction blocks the close so it may make sense to use rollback(timeout) in the close case, because the socket will close and the broker side transaction will rollback.

Note the transaction rollback used to be async before: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2364
having a timeout would be similar, but I guess so long as we always close it would be ok.

I see an interesting angle in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-1517 where the broker side blocking is limited by the message time to live. That would make a deterministic failure scenario. Message expired while pending space for send.
That would leave the broker side active to respond to a close.
Do you use messageExpiry or would it be a valid alternative?;;;","11/Apr/16 16:30;kenhalldnb;We don't use message expiry as we take a very minimal approach to our configuration. Looking at that solution I was reminded that the issue here might be time zone differences. We will have to communicate with queues on a multiplicity of customers brokers so we cannot make any assumptions or influence their configurations.

(cherry picked from commit ea09159a4087212964787e7cf68ef30170d115f0)
;;;","21/Mar/16 19:58;cshannon;There was a race condition when using concurrent store and dispatch for queues.  The issue is that KahaDB calls beoreMarshall() when storing which then calls storeContentAndClear() on the message which clears out the text field.  With concurrent store and dispatch on this can cause both content and text to end up null if the marshalling happens at the same time the message is being copied in another thread.  

I fixed this by grabbing a copy of the text before the rest of the copy method is called and then using that as the value.  The other methods in ActiveMQTextMessage follow a similar pattern of grabbing local references of the text and content fields to try and minimize other threads from interfering.

I did not add synchronization to prevent a performance hit but If other issues pop up we might need to explicitly synchronize access on those two fields in a future version to prevent other race conditions.;;;","22/Mar/16 18:58;cshannon;A new fix has been applied as part of AMQ-6221;;;","15/Apr/16 13:02;jira-bot;Commit 9c929b6870ae4c19cf4f227fa13472b09ebac729 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Using a small maxBrowsePageSize and maxExpirePageSize should suffice to ensure a window for dispatch but this currently fails because the limits are not enforced.

Specifically, when I used the org.apache.activemq.jaas.PropertiesLoginModule with reload=true, changes in user name and password were reflected in connections after the changes, but changes in group membership was not reloaded/picked up by new connections.

The configuration of my broker xml and users.properties, groups.properties, as well as the login.config files are attached.  

The problem was repeatable always.

The cause of the problem was identified as the groups membership was cached and the cache was not cleared (reloaded) after the groups.properties file change.

The fix is to add one line of code in the org.apache.activemq.jaas.ReloadableProperties.java class.

The src code with the fix for org.apache.activemq.jaas.ReloadableProperties.java is attached in the ticket as well.

Please verify the fix and merge this one line of code change in org.apache.activemq.jaas.ReloadableProperties.java class in src branches for 5.13.0 as I tested the problem with 5.13.0 only.  The fix should be carried forward and retroactively merged into previous versions as well.

There is no negative impact on software or any noticeable impact on server performance.

    Do not store selector information of temporary destinations.
    
    Since the selector information is not cleared after the destination is removed, the cache grows with every temporary destinations, and a use case where a consumer would ever reconnect to a temporary queue for reception is hard to imagine.

I took your example and re-wrote it slightly with JUnit to demonstrate the issue and uploaded it as an attachment.   

[~gtully], If you run the test case you will see that the statistics report back a message count of 2 instead of 1.  The issue here is pretty simple, it's on line 857 of the Queue class: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java#L857

The problem is the temp queue is part of a transaction, but since its store is null that if statement is always true so it executes the messageSent() method there and also again when the transaction completes which leads to the statistics updating twice.

Seems like we could just delete the {{store == null}} part because I think any non temporary destination should always have a store.  Could also just change it to {{if ((store == null && !destination.isTemporary()) || (!context.isInTransaction() && !message.isPersistent()))}}

But I wanted to run it by you first to see what you think since you were the last person to have touched that line in this commit https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=54e2e3bef290d7455d9d1ba3420d12dc4805b339;;;","07/Mar/16 11:29;gtully;[~cshannon] thanks for the heads up!
The intent is to match tryOrderedCursorAdd, 2nd else clause.
Where there is no ordering issue with non persistent messages and when the store == null all messages are non persistent.
https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java#L879

To match that clearly I think it should be: {code}if ( !context.isInTransaction() && !( store == null && message.isPersistent())) {code}

An alternative approach would be to delete that line altogether and add a call to messageSend in tryOrderedCursorAdd.
ie: When there is no order issue, add to the cursor and add to the stats.
That keeps the logic and the action nicely together so the intent is a little more clear.

There used to be a sendLock, and it idea was to do the stats update outside of that lock, hence the separation. With the send lock gone, there is no good reason not to inline the call to sendMessage in the tryOrderedCursorAdd

;;;","07/Mar/16 13:32;cshannon;Thanks for the explanation [~gtully]. I like the idea of getting rid of that line and moving the stats to tryOrderedCursorAdd as it is cleaner.  I will apply the fix and a test shortly.;;;","07/Mar/16 14:20;jira-bot;Commit 903dec615c7932475bd3e6cd869af25f01de64b2 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Fixing an issue that caused statistics for a transactional temporary
queue to be updated twice by mistake.  Moved the statistics update into
tryOrderedCursorAdd so that the update is called immediately only if
not inside a transaction.
;;;","01/Jul/16 07:52;hakanj;In our production test environment this bug causes the ActiveMQ kahadb store limit to be reached, even though there is not a single message currently in the broker. The ""data/kahadb"" directory fills up with database log files, stopping the broker from working.

We have several clients using request-response where the response queue is a temporary queue. Each client has its own temporary queue which is reused for all requests during the lifetime of the client process, as recommended [by the ActiveMQ documentation|http://activemq.apache.org/how-should-i-implement-request-response-with-jms.html].
When we look at the temp queues using hawtio we see that the _EnqueueCount_ is always two times the _DequeueCount_, even though no messages can be fetched from the queue, aka ""ghost"" messages.

Because of the seriousness of this issue I would consider this issue to be at least _Major_, not _Minor_ as it is today.

If we manually build ActiveMQ with this patch, then this issue goes away, but we would prefer to have an official release instead.
We would be very happy if a new release containing this fix could be prioritized.;;;","01/Jul/16 10:38;jira-bot;Commit 7ddfa97d0173b07346ea8fdfcb8e6545766e0d39 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~cshannon]

In fact, specifically for Http transport, the inactivity monitor skips all the wire format information. 
In this case the connection checker task is never canceled and this causes the connector to be stopped after 30 seconds because the monitor thinks that the connection has never been established.

In order to not wait for the issue to be fixed, you can overcome the problem by turning off connection checker (that does not make sense for http transport). Read and write checks for keep alive will by the way work as designed.

Just add connectAttemptTimeout=0 to your transport options (also in network connectors)

We have reports of up to 400GB of scheduler log files. I have tried to isolate the issue and create a minimal example (attached). In the troubleshooting I have done, the scheduler GC process is running, it's just deciding not to GC files that it should be. I have also found behavior inconsistent on the log files it does remove. 

The ran the attached example/test on 5.10.0, 5.11.1, 5.12.0 and 5.13.0. The test schedules 20 messages that are large enough to cause 4 log files to be created. It then consumes all 20 messages. When on 5.10.0, it behaves like I would expect, files 1-3 are GC'd and the 4th (the current log file) is left. On all other versions I've tried it always leaves the first 2 files, and sometimes will GC the 3rd.

Below is a snippet from the log of the scheduler process and why it's deciding not to GC these files:

commit 364e10d40569042595ec27ae710c2fd687fa2746
Author: Marc Breslow <marc.breslow@devfactory.com>
Date:   2016-01-28T21:39:29Z

    Fix Impossible Cast issues in MemoryTopicSub:
    - recoverSubscription()
    -- map is defined as LinkedHashMap<MessageId, Message>
    -- msg is defined as <map> entry.getValue() so must be a Message
    -- condition if (msg.getClass() == MessageId.class) could never be true
    -- no need to cast at all when using generics
    
    - recoverNextMessages()
    -- basically same code copy/pasted so same fix

commit 61f951d0c811b8c9dcde306fa7843aadce70d199
Author: Marc Breslow <marc.breslow@devfactory.com>
Date:   2016-01-29T15:51:18Z

    Removed 2 conditions from ServerSessionPoolImpl that would result in impossible casts. Conditions removed were trying to cast ActiveMQQueueSession and ActiveMQTopicSession to ActiveMQSession which is illegal.
    
    Since it isn't obvious what to do if you get an ActiveMQQueueSession or ActiveMQTopicSession from getServerSession() I make it fall back to the else condition which raises an async exception. This is better than getting a ClassCastException at runtime.

   ### Description
   Re-using LDAP context for authentication. The context is created only once and re-used each time ActiveMQ server established connection with ActiveMQ clients.
   Refactoring some code in LDAPLoginModule.java
   This PR is based on fix introduced to Artemis: https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/f3a8619d7eeabded75f3725f2e77af267e8cb450#diff-706fd9b54d2aed5a0ea5d28fa7c70f7ee733672f7e91d847137517e3b147d716
   
   ### Testing
   Manual test authentication using LDAP

It's controlled by a simple time-out.  You can see the details in [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.security.impl.SecurityStoreImpl|https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/master/artemis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/security/impl/SecurityStoreImpl.java];;;","01/Feb/16 20:29;tabish;Use the cached LDAP Authorization Map: http://activemq.apache.org/cached-ldap-authorization-module.html;;;","03/Feb/16 22:39;alt_alt;Hi Timothy,
I am talking about AUTHENTICATION, not authorization. The cached LDAP Authorization Map does NOT help at all. 
In our case, we have hundreds of application servers, and we use pooled connection factory with max connection number of 5. The ActiveMQ server has to create more than a thousand connections to LDAP service when it is trying to establish the huge number of connections from application servers. That does not make sense and ldap server could deny access due to the huge number of connections to it. Think about if we have 5 ActiveMQ servers, each server has to create 1000 connections to LDAP server. sooner or later, the ldap server will be exhausted.

This is an real ISSUE when we are trying to adopt ActiveMQ for big application clusters.

Thanks;;;","03/Feb/16 22:43;alt_alt;Hi Justin,
Is there any release schedule for this project? We are trying to adopt ActiveMQ as our message bus for our application servers, but since we use ldap authentication and authorization, we soon found the ldap service itself will become a bottleneck due to huge requirements for establishing connections from ActiveMQ servers. 

Thanks;;;","03/Feb/16 23:02;jbertram;[~alt_alt], the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker has had [3 releases already|http://activemq.apache.org/artemis/download.html].;;;","04/Feb/16 23:41;alt_alt;Hi Justin,
It looks like another project instead of a plugin in ActiveMQ, have you considered to fix this issue in the future release of ActiveMQ, it is really important for us to adopt ActiveMQ for huge clusters of application servers.

Thanks;;;","05/Feb/16 01:28;jbertram;That's correct.  ActiveMQ Artemis is not a plugin to ActiveMQ but a broker in and of itself.  Artemis supports clustering.  Most of the same kinds of clustering features that ActiveMQ 5.x supports are also supported in Artemis so if you want a huge cluster then you can certainly have it with Artemis.;;;","08/Feb/16 23:41;alt_alt;Hi Justin,
Thanks for your reply, but the problem is that we already setup ActiveMQ as our message bus and it is already online for production now. It should be no easy for us to replace it with another one. So we still hope the fix coming in the future release of ActiveMQ. Is that possible?

Thanks;;;","09/Feb/16 12:25;gtully;looks like we could pull back the fix from artemis for this. I don't see any reason why we cannot cache the ldap context and reuse it for subsequent logins. There may even be a way to pool ldap connections.;;;","10/Feb/16 18:48;alt_alt;Cool!

Fixing a race condition that exists in the decompress method of
ActiveMQBytesMessage that can cause an invalid length to be read.

(cherry picked from commit 5f7a81f9280fb65b8a3c1f85c4570a18d87fafd9)
;;;","01/Feb/16 17:44;cshannon;Thanks for the test cases.  There was a race condition in the decompress method of ActiveMQBytesMessage.  I applied a fix and include a variation of one of your tests to make sure to catch this problem if it comes back in the future.;;;","06/Apr/16 11:34;gtully;[~cshannon] sorry for the late input. I was peeking at this change and some of the sync from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6218 etc.

Message intentionally has no sync, the intent is that copy is called if mods will be made. There is one before dispatch to a consumer that should sort this issue.
However, the copy seems broken.
For this bytesMessage case, it looks like the root cause is in message.copy where the content ByteSequence is referenced rather than copied in error.

For AMQ-6218 - if all of those issues relate to concurrentStoreAndDispatch, it may be that we need to take a message.copy for the async store case.

Let me attach a diff to see if this makes sense to you.;;;","06/Apr/16 11:35;gtully;amq-6142.diff - file attach. Show the problem with message.copy that seems to be the root cause cc [~cshannon];;;","06/Apr/16 12:10;cshannon;[~gtully], This diff makes sense to fix the copy which is the root of the issue.  My commit had a test so if this diff is applied as a new commit CI can check that everything is still good.

For AMQ-6218, yes the entire problem comes down to concurrentStoreAndDispatch.  I talked to [~tabish121] about it a little and the problem shows up when using the VM transport because of the same message reference but two different threads accessing it.  There are other messages that could be fixed but the text message is the main issue because of the fix from AMQ-5857 where we clear out the text after converting to bytes so that the data isn't stored twice but only counted once.  So you can get into this weird state where both bytes and text end up being null.   

Copying the message before doing the async store would fix this issue for sure and would allow the sync that I added to be backed out.  We could also back out the fix from AMQ-5857 as it was only applied to text messages (but other messages have the same issue i think) which would fix the issue as well.  I think that backing out the sync and copying the message before the async store makes the most sense but I didn't do that originally because I was concerned about the extra memory usage for large messages and for the memory usage counter to not take that into account.  But the copy is probably the right thing to do to prevent future problems with the async store case.;;;","06/Apr/16 13:39;cshannon;Also if we go the copy route we would need to take a look at the async listener that runs after completion.  I recently committed a fix to move the clearMarshalledState() call into the listener (if reduce memory footprint is on) and I think that might still need to run on the original message, not the copy since the copy should be GC's anyways after it's written.;;;","06/Apr/16 14:06;gtully;good point, but thinking some more, the copy may be problematic because the concurrentStore stuff is coordinated through state in the messageId which is also copied. Will need to do some more root cause analysis on the concurrentStoreAndDisptch cases.;;;","06/Apr/16 17:02;cshannon;[~gtully], Seems like this same issue reported in AMQ-6218 that caused me to add synchronization has also come up before in AMQ-2966.  What do you think about rolling back the fix I added from AMQ-5857 that clears out the text field after marshalling?  That was the start of all of these issues since state is now mutated and before it wasn't.  The downside is that the data would once again be stored twice leading to possible OOM issues, including for clients which is why originally AMQ-5857 was submitted.  So it would be nice to be able to clear it out but not if other concurrent issues keep popping up.

Also, on a related note having to do with changing message state during dispatch, as I was digging back through some of this stuff I was looking at the reduceMemoryFootPrint flag and wondering if it could be applied to topics.  I'm guessing it caused issues before so it wasn't applied (maybe with concurrent store and dispatch for topics) but it would be useful to be able to turn it on, especially if concurrent store and dispatch is off, which is the default.  ;;;","07/Apr/16 14:04;gtully;there is some more context in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2103;;;","07/Apr/16 16:04;gtully;[~cshannon] I think rolling back the sync is best, then thinking of mutation being ok on your own copy which implies maybe doing more copies and those not sharing mutable state. Client side there is typically a copy per consumer. 
Broker side there is a single copy of the message at the moment and the reduceMemoryFootPrint policy can control whacking the duplicate state on send/store for a queue. concurrentStoreAndDispatch muddies that a bit.
;;;","08/Apr/16 11:14;cshannon;Yep agreed, lets roll back the sync I added.  I think the Jira reported for AMQ-5857 was about client side and not the broker side (since reduceMemoryFootprint exists to clear the duplicate state, at least for queues).  I would say we either need to roll that commit back as well or maybe figure out a way so that the client can clear out the state but the broker won't clear it out until it is safe to do so.;;;","11/Apr/16 12:32;jira-bot;Commit e69c2cbad6611fa355bd9eb592f03bd3b8f90abb in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Normally when KahaDB gets a KahaUpdateMessageCommand it will update the index with the new location.  This works except that if the index is deleted or corrupted and needs to be rebuilt, the replay process may not be able to recover the message.

This happens because after the message is updated, KahaDB is free to garbage collect the file with the original add command.  So, whatt happens is that during replay when the update command is seen KahaDB rejects it because it can't find the original message if that file has been GC'd.  This happens in the updateIndex method of MessageDatabase on line 1395 where it prints out a warning saying ""Non existent message update attempt rejected"".

I am attaching a unit test that demonstrates the issue where the count after restart is missing messages.

I have attached a test that shows the Queue case breaking.  I think it will also break for durables in certain conditions.  One easy solution is to change line 1416 in MessageDatabase (the warning log message) to {{this.updateIndex(tx, command, location);}} and simply add the message if it can't find it.  However, this is probably not desirable in all cases as I'm guessing there are times when the update should be rejected (such as after an ack).

The issue occurs when persistJmsRedelivered is turned on for a Queue and concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues is used.

What I'm seeing is that when rapidly producing/consuming, after a consumer gets all of the messages, sometimes the message reappears.  The cause seems to be that sometimes the message has been acked by the consumer and removed after it has been added to the store but before the update command runs (to set the redelivered flag).  So what happens with this fix is that at the end it will try to update a non-existent message so it will end up re-adding it.

In a test on my machine with 1 producer/consumer rapidly producing and consuming 50k messages, at the end of the test I consistently see 10-20 messages left over in the store even though the consumer has already received them all.  

I'm investigating more now to see if there is a good way to fix this without having to completely back out this patch.;;;","01/Apr/16 13:08;cshannon;Actually, I think what is happening is that the update command is running first because it's not done async like the add message command.

I think concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues is not compatible with persistJmsRedelivered. The point of persistJmsRedelivered is that the delivery count is persisted *before* dispatch which is not the case with concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues.
One attribute is a policyEntry, the other on the PA, so it is not easy to enforce but the combination do not make sense.
Maybe the update is done async but we wait on the future, or we update the inflight write and wait on its future.
Either way, it may not be trivial and it may be more straightforward to document the incompatibility. The two features are working against each other.
To force them to coexist will impact both.;;;","01/Apr/16 14:13;cshannon;Good points, and it may not make sense to change anything other than to document the behavior better as pointed out.  I'm testing out a couple things today to see what a fix would look like.  I was thinking one thing that might work would be to update the message that is part of the async task if the task hasn't started executing yet, else if it has executed then go through the normal update.  Not sure of any side effects of that approach yet though.;;;","01/Apr/16 14:41;cshannon;[~gtully], After some testing, I agree with your assessment to do nothing.  Indeed it doesn't really make any sense to try and make the two features coexist.  One issue of trying to update a message async is then you can't guarantee that it was persisted before dispatch so you negate any benefits. And you already alluded to this when you mentioned the point is to persist before dispatch.  In fact, if anything, I'm seeing slower message rates with added synchronization from trying to do the update.

In the doMessageSend() method inside Queue where asyncAddQueueMessage() is called, do you think it makes sense to check there if the destination has persistJmsRedelivered enabled and if it does call addMessage() instead?

I like that, isPersistJMSRedelivered is likely selectively used.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6133

Disabling async queue message store when persistJMSRedelivered is turned
on for a destination.  That flag will cause a sync update later on
dispatch which can cause a race condition if the original message add is
processed after the update.  This can cause a duplicate message to be
stored.

When taking a look at the activemq logs, we can see messages like this (I've changed queue names and client IPs):

2015-12-17 20:52:37,375 | INFO  | Usage(default:memory:queue://Consumer.AAA.VirtualTopic.OFFER:memory) percentUsage=100%, usage=104858538, limit=104857600, percentUsageMinDelta=1%;Parent:Usage(default:memory) percentUsage=42%, usage=305669289, limit=720424141, percentUsageMinDelta=1%: Usage Manager Memory Limit reached. Producer (ID:ip-172-30-0-97-38230-1450370654525-1:8:1:1) stopped to prevent flooding queue://Consumer.AAA.VirtualTopic.OFFER. See http://activemq.apache.org/producer-flow-control.html for more info (blocking for: 151s) | org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///1.1.1.1:36128@61616

The strange thing is, when taking a look at the admin interface, there are no messages queued in the above mentioned queue and also purging the queue does not help.

The only thing that works (that we found out so far) (to get the broker process messages again) in the above situation is:
 * delete the queue (it then is recreated automatically and works again)
 * restart the broker

I have now tried to reproduce the situation locally and come up with a test case that, while I am not sure if that is the exact problem that we face in production, at least produces the same problem as mentioned above. I have noticed that we sometimes have network issues between the clients and the broker and therefore have done something similar in the test code.

The test code launches 4 producing threads and 4 consuming threads. The producers > 1000 messages / sec to the queues and the consumers just read them. Once after a while (every 10 seconds), one of the consuming threads is interrupted and then, with a delay of another 10 seconds, the connection is cleaned up (to free up the allocated messages that are already in the dead connections prefetchBuffer). 

When running the test case on a fresh download of activeMQ 5.13.0, it takes a long time until the broker completey blocks, as it takes time for the memory to fill up. However, when checking JMX stats, it is clearly visible, that the following metrics behave strangely:
 * CursorMemoryUsage
 * MemoryUsageByteCount

Both above metrics are quite constant for some time, and then, once a thread gets interrupted and the connection cleaned up, it suddenly increases by couple of mbytes ... then, again, while the consumers and producers work normally, the size is quite constant, until again, a consumer is interrupted, which again increases memory for couple of mbytes ... and this continues until memory is completely full and no messages can pass anymore through the broker.

To speed things up, a lower memory limit can be placed on the queue in the activemq.xml configuration file, which will lead to shorter waiting time before the broker blocks messages on the queue.

Even terminating the client jvm does not free up resources on the broker.",Unmodified release version of ActiveMQ 5.13.0 (http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/activemq/5.13.0/apache-activemq-5.13.0-bin.tar.gz),cshannon,d.bieringer,felixehm,gtully,jira-bot,lichtin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMQ-6014,,,,,,,,"18/Dec/15 07:21;d.bieringer;Test.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778441/Test.java","18/Dec/15 17:17;cshannon;Test6094JUnit.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778522/Test6094JUnit.java",,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Tue Jan 05 15:08:48 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2q2tz:",9223372036854775807,Regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18/Dec/15 07:21;d.bieringer;Test Case;;;","18/Dec/15 07:26;d.bieringer;Running the same test code with 5.12.1 works correctly and the described issue does not appear.;;;","18/Dec/15 08:30;d.bieringer;Also tried it now with 5.12.2 (built with code from GitHub) and this version seems to be affected by the above described problem as well (I've added it to the affected versions);;;","18/Dec/15 17:15;cshannon;Thanks for reporting this.

For the bug portion, when a new policy is added there is no check to see if there are any more specific policies that should be used.  So if a policy called ""queue.test.child.>"" exists, and then a new policy for ""queue.test.>"" is added, this will update destinations that match the more specific policy and it shouldn't.  There is a check for this for modification (as seen below) but not on adding a new policy.

For the improvement, when modifying a policy entry, an entry can only be modified if there are no children entries.  This is a problem because if two policies exist, say for ""queue.test.>"" and ""queue.test.child.>"", we can not modify ""queue.test.>"" because there is logic to prevent this.  This is done to prevent reapplying changes to destinations that might be affected by ""queue.test.child.>"".  (which breaks on an add)

However, with the use of the policy map we should be able to update any policy and figure out which specific destinations because we can look up whether or not the policy being updated should be applied to the destination.  So this limitation should be removed and the proper logic should be applied for both adding and updating policies.

This should be merged into 5.13.1 because it's a bug fix and improvement to how policies are applied.

On start up, KahaDB will first set this value as the OpenWire version used in the index metadata in memory, and then if it detects a different version when reading in an existing index, it will reset the the version to the version that was detected.

The problem is that if a corrupted index is detected during the reading of the index, the metadata is recreated in the catch block but the storeOpenWireVersion that was set on the BrokerService is never copied back to the new Metadata.  This happens in the open() method of MessageDatabase.

This causes marshalling errors because the index will now be recreated with the default OpenWire version instead of the actual version that was set on the broker.

I had tested this with our integration tests which uses Jetty's client websocket client library and Firefox, and of course that's the one browser that works :)

The issue is that most likely you are using the stomp.js library and that library is setting the accepted sub protocol (the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header) as ""v10.stomp"" and ""v11.stomp"".  However, the web socket server in ActiveMQ is setting the accepted protocol to just plain ""stomp"", so there is no match.  I will put a fix in for this so in 5.13.1 all 3 protocol strings will be there.

For now, as a work around, you should be able to specify the protocol if you are using stomp.js (or any other websocket client).  For stomp.js, if you look at http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/doc/ there is information on how to change the subprotocol, which should be ""stomp"" for now.  For example, you would switch your connection line from: 

{{Stomp.client(url)}} to {{Stomp.client(url, \['stomp'])}}

and that should work.;;;","05/Dec/15 09:17;a.marchand@progeri.com;This is working thx.;;;","07/Dec/15 15:33;jira-bot;Commit 913f64476b66c452fa03cb4fb8c09d831825bca5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6068 - fix and test. Cleanup from ra managed connection needs to remove the connection info, leaving the tcp connection free for another identity. Possibly this could be conditional on having a user supplied clientId
;;;","03/May/17 18:38;hanson;The fix for this bug introduces an unwanted behaviour in our activemq cluster.
We are running JBoss 6.4 with a Java EE application that processes around 25000 msg per minute throught couple of JMS queues.
The application consumes one message, does some logic and then post a message on another queue. 
The applucation is running with XA-transaction enabled.

We recently upgraded from activemq-rar.rar version 5.13.5 to 5.14.5 and noticed that the A-MQ cluster started to behave strange,
one issue was that the nodes in the cluster (network of brokers) ran out of native memory. 

We have now come to the conclusion that the fix for this issue forces the activemq client to send a new ConnectionInfo message
to the broker for every message it processes. This get passed around in the cluster via Advisory messages and both memory consumtion
and CPU load went up on all brokers. The information sent in the connectionInfo is in our case always the same thing, i.e. we don't set any clientId etc.

There is almost no use having a JCA connection pool for activemq resource adapter when it cant avoid sending ConnectionInfo messages.

We have reverted back to 5.13.5 for now.  ;;;","04/May/17 09:39;gtully;thanks for the feedback. It may make sense to have this full cleanup conditional on a user specifying a client id.
However, the old cleanup would remove any consumer info, so the advisory load would be the same;
Usually only demand information, ie: consumer add/remove is propagated across a network.

There may be something else in the mix that is leading to the excessive memory usage.;;;","04/May/17 10:08;jira-bot;Commit 2bd337993285d83549fdb9d9f9b96712bb6fed69 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

The problem happens when using JDBC persistency with ActiveMQ 5.10.0. After a short look to source code, the same problem could be also with 5.12.1.

Test case:
- run ActiveMQ broker with JDBC persistency
- create subscription to a topic, but do not receive the messages
- send enough number of messages with short TimeToLive
- when expireMessagesTask is scheduled, it tries to load all of the messages and causes the OutOfMemoryError

It would be fine if
{noformat}
org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.JDBCMessageStore.recover(MessageRecoveryListener)
{noformat}
will be updated like this:
{code:java}
public void recover(final MessageRecoveryListener listener) throws Exception {
  // Get all the Message ids out of the database.
  TransactionContext c = persistenceAdapter.getTransactionContext();
  try {
    c = persistenceAdapter.getTransactionContext();
    adapter.doRecover(c, destination, new JDBCMessageRecoveryListener() {
      public boolean recoverMessage(long sequenceId, byte[] data) throws Exception {
        if (listener.hasSpace()) {
          Message msg = (Message)wireFormat.unmarshal(new ByteSequence(data));
          msg.getMessageId().setBrokerSequenceId(sequenceId);
          return listener.recoverMessage(msg);
        } else {
          logger.debug(""Recovery limit of the messages has exceeded."");
          return false;
        }                    
      }

      public boolean recoverMessageReference(String reference) throws Exception {
        if (listener.hasSpace()) {
          return listener.recoverMessageReference(new MessageId(reference));
        } else {
          logger.debug(""Recovery limit of the message references has exceeded."");
          return false;
        }
      }
    });
  } catch (SQLException e) {
    JDBCPersistenceAdapter.log(""JDBC Failure: "", e);
    throw IOExceptionSupport.create(""Failed to recover container. Reason: "" + e, e);
  } finally {
    c.close();
  }
}
{code}

But I am not sure if this limitation is the best way, because there will be some messages that should be expired, but need to wait. So better solution might be to do this job in more separated transactions.",,cshannon,cszczotka,gtully,itsganu@gmail.com,jira-bot,phavran,smrui,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Fri Aug 26 18:34:44 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2p2gv:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30/Nov/15 16:41;gtully;ideally we would be able to have a store cursor that would walk the messages in the store independent of the dispatch/prefetch cursors. In the meantime, the intent is that the destination memory limit or the MaxExpirePageSize (which ever is smaller) should limit a browse for expiry.
The logic in Queue.java does a loop paging in messages to reach the memory limit in maxPagesize chunks, that same logic could be applied to durable subs.
In any event, the limit needs to be checked via the hasSpace callback from the recover call so that fix looks sensible.;;;","30/Nov/15 16:57;gtully;the follow up to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3362 introduced a fix and test for this.

Could someone please check this issue, this has become big pain now
Every time we have to restart to over come this issue, the number of messages is quite huge and we're planning to send the records in chunk but not sure if that can solve this issue;;;","04/Aug/16 10:30;cszczotka;Hi,
I see under debugger that for version 5.13.2 in org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Topic the expireMessagesTask does not check max expire page size which is passed as a parameter to the doBrowse method:

private final Runnable expireMessagesTask = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        List<Message> browsedMessages = new InsertionCountList<Message>();
        doBrowse(browsedMessages, getMaxExpirePageSize());
    }
};


In my case I have default settings for max expire page size eq 400. In doBrowse method are collected all messages belongs to topic into browseList and never is checked max ( or called hasSpace internal method):

private void doBrowse(final List<Message> browseList, final int max) {
    try {
        if (topicStore != null) {
            final List<Message> toExpire = new ArrayList<Message>();
            topicStore.recover(new MessageRecoveryListener() {
                @Override
                public boolean recoverMessage(Message message) throws Exception {
                    if (message.isExpired()) {
                        toExpire.add(message);
                    }
                    browseList.add(message);
                    return true;
                }

                @Override
                public boolean recoverMessageReference(MessageId messageReference) throws Exception {
                    return true;
                }

                @Override
                public boolean hasSpace() {
                    return browseList.size() < max;
                }

                @Override
                public boolean isDuplicate(MessageId id) {
                    return false;
                }
            });
            final ConnectionContext connectionContext = createConnectionContext();
   ...
}
 
In other words if you have 1 000 000 messages under ACTIVEMQ_MSGS table for same topic all messages will be collected into memory ( browseList) and this can cause OutOfMemoryError.
;;;","04/Aug/16 10:45;gtully;Thank you [~cszczotka], that is indeed a bug, seems only return from recoverMessage is checked by the store.
maybe https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/e2b4ca2c59a316be91cf391c758a10e518dd3a1f/activemq-unit-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/usecases/ExpiredMessagesWithNoConsumerTest.java can provide some inspiration for a unit test to capture this use case and the fix into the future.;;;","08/Aug/16 12:42;cszczotka;Question is how we can mitigate this memory issue for system where is running amq 5.13.2. I  can  try to increase –Xmx, make smaller expireMessagesPeriods so we will expire messages more frequently. Do you see other options ?;;;","08/Aug/16 13:19;cshannon;Not much can be done to truly fix it without a patch.  In the recover method of DefaultJDBCAdapter there needs to be a hasSpace() check done in the recovery loop so it can abort early if memory is full just like KahaDB does.  The proposed fix posted above does exactly this check and looks good to me so it can probably be targeted for a 5.14.1 release.

In the meantime, as you pointed out you can try things like more memory and smaller expire messages period to give yourself a better chance of not running out of memory.
;;;","09/Aug/16 07:19;cszczotka;Hi,
I see another issue in amq 5.13.2 related with topic message expiration.   I have one producer which send me messages to MyTopic and one durable subscriber/consumer. Messages are stored in DB and after 30 seconds amq broker trying to expire these messages ( I have configuration entry for this: <amq:policyEntry topic=""MyTopic.>"" expireMessagesPeriod=""30000""> ). I’m getting NullPointerException from AdvisoryBroker and messages are never expired and remain in activemq_msgs table.

It is logged on console as WARN:

09:25:30.274 [ActiveMQ Broker[my-broker] Scheduler] WARN  org.apache.activemq.advisory.AdvisoryBroker - Failed to fire expired advisory, reason: java.lang.NullPointerException



Under debugger I see that in org.apache.activemq.advisory.AdvisoryBroker.messageExpired  baseDestination is null and call baseDestination.getActiveMQDestination() generates NPE

@Override
public void messageExpired(ConnectionContext context, MessageReference messageReference, Subscription subscription) {
    super.messageExpired(context, messageReference, subscription);
    try {
        if (!messageReference.isAdvisory()) {
            BaseDestination baseDestination = (BaseDestination) messageReference.getMessage().getRegionDestination();
            ActiveMQTopic topic = AdvisorySupport.getExpiredMessageTopic(baseDestination.getActiveMQDestination());

 Below is code how messages are produced:

public static class Producer implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        try {
            ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(BROKER_ULR);
            Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
            connection.start();
            Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
            Topic destination = session.createTopic(""MyTopic"");

            MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
            producer.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT);
            producer.setTimeToLive(30000);
          
            for(int i =0; i < 10; i ++) {
                String text = ""Message number "" + i +  ""  From: "" + Thread.currentThread().getName();
                TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(text);
                message.setJMSDestination(destination);
                producer.send(destination, message);

                Thread.sleep(10000);
            }
            // Clean up
            session.close();
            connection.close();
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(""Caught: "" + e);
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Under debugger I see that setter method setRegionDestination (org.apache.activemq.command.Message ) is called in org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Topic class before message is send:
  
@Override
public void send(final ProducerBrokerExchange producerExchange, final Message message) throws Exception {
    final ConnectionContext context = producerExchange.getConnectionContext();

    final ProducerInfo producerInfo = producerExchange.getProducerState().getInfo();
    producerExchange.incrementSend();
    final boolean sendProducerAck = !message.isResponseRequired() && producerInfo.getWindowSize() > 0
            && !context.isInRecoveryMode();

    message.setRegionDestination(this);

I don’t see call this setRegionDestination method when message is loaded from db into memory.

Do you have any idea what can be wrong ? Is it issue in my messages (something is missing)  or it is another bug in amq code ?

        if (message != null) {

        return false;
    }

This will obviously be very slow.  Given the Map is keyed by message ID, can't we do a .contains(message.getMessageId()) instead?  I noticed the remove() method does this.  I changed the code to do this:
{code}
@Override

The Broker may enter a state of high CPU consumption (100% or 200% if 2 browse enter the infinite loop in the same time on a multi-core) when a command line browse on multiple queues is issued. When that arrives the only way we found to restore the situation was to kill the broker and restart because he was not responding anymore to clients. Killing the clients and the browse process does not lower the CPU usage of the broker.
I assume the infinite loop based on successive thread dumps that show the browse thread remaines in the same code zone:

Here is an example of the Browse thread call stack trace, when Broker is in high CPU usage state:

Tested ActiveMQ versions: 5.9.1 and the last, 5.12.0, but of course I suppose all in beetwen are affected.

The cause seems to be the non-threadsafe usage of the *audit HashMap* member of *QueueBrowserSubscription.java* class.
Here are some facts on non thread-safe HashMap use problems:
*High CPU / Hang on java.util.HashMap.findNonNullKeyEntry() due to non-thread-safe usage of HashMap*
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21597581
*IZ73767: INFINITE LOOP CAN OCCUR IN HASHMAP*
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ73767

I must underline that *this is not an IBM JDK specific problem as the IBM JDK is based on Oracle JDK* and changing the JDK or JRE is not a solution.

The scenario may be produced with a fresh non modified install (default config) of ActiveMQ broker:
1. set ACTIVEMQ_HOME, JAVA_HOME and PATH to point accordingly to the right activemq, and Java version.
2. cd $ACTIVEMQ_HOME/bin; ./activemq start
3. inject at least 2000 messages in each of two ques, say QA.ONE and QA.TWO
4. $ $ACTIVEMQ_HOME/bin/activemq browse --view JMSDestination,JMSMessageID --amqurl tcp://localhost:61616 QA.*

The simplest fix that I suggest is to change in the *QueueBrowserSubscription.java* class the type of *audit* member to *ConcurrentHashMap*.","Linux Ubuntu, Aix, with both Java 6 and Java 7 (either IBM or Oracle)",cshannon,doomytroo,jira-bot,tabish,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86400,86400,,0%,86400,86400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"02/Dec/15 15:31;doomytroo;AMQ6062Test.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12775318/AMQ6062Test.java","25/Nov/15 13:11;doomytroo;ActiveMQ_BrowseInfiniteLoopUseCase.jmx;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12774337/ActiveMQ_BrowseInfiniteLoopUseCase.jmx","02/Dec/15 15:31;doomytroo;HotSpotThreadDump.txt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12775319/HotSpotThreadDump.txt","02/Dec/15 15:35;doomytroo;IBMjava7AndAMQMaster.javacore.20151202.161643.18441.0001.txt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12775321/IBMjava7AndAMQMaster.javacore.20151202.161643.18441.0001.txt","25/Nov/15 13:19;doomytroo;ThreadStatusAnalysis_2015-11-25_14h13m33s.png;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12774338/ThreadStatusAnalysis_2015-11-25_14h13m33s.png","02/Dec/15 14:56;doomytroo;activemq-test.log;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12775308/activemq-test.log",,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ73767,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Wed Dec 02 17:51:35 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2ox8f:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"25/Nov/15 13:11;doomytroo;JMeter test plan to produce the bug;;;","25/Nov/15 13:19;doomytroo;Thread dump analysis screenshot;;;","25/Nov/15 18:43;tabish;Have you tried reproducing this with a JMS client in a Unit test, would be a useful validation of any fixes.  ;;;","26/Nov/15 08:59;doomytroo;I already attached a JMeter test plan that injects messages in 2 queues and after that starts calling browse in 2 threads.
You just have to adapt the paths to your ActiveMQ.

It works for me with 5.9.1 tag sources and IBM java6 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
The test is a bit complicated because I tried to make it fail() and fail fast, do a thread dump and not block or kill the JVM without a JUnit failure.

I run the test from Eclipse. I just came to realise you might test from command line or other ways (in Jenkins, etc) and I did a test on command line and JUnit does not fail because the kill is faster and maven test is in success in spite of the bug detection.

In case you want to add the test on Git repo you'll have to work on it because it is not deterministic depending on timeout and browse task count parameters when the timeout arrives before all browse finish.

1. Default ActiveMQ 5.12.1 package with the attached activemq.xml.
2. Send a message to a queue with expiration time one second.
4. After the expiry time, the message will be moved to DLQ. This can be monitored by the AMQ web console.
5. Restart AMQ. You will find that the message disappear from the AMQ web console. Try to consume the message from the DLQ, nothing is received.

*Cause Analysis*
1. KahaDB works well. It means the cause should be related to the leveldb mechanism.
2. In my understanding, the JMS message is persistent to a log file and leveldb will maintain to a reference to the position where the JMS message is stored in the log. After a message expires, AMQ will copy the expired JMS message and the reference to the posistion is also copied, then send to DLQ. When AMQ restarts, DLQ will recover the message from the persistent storage. Since the DLQ message shares the same reference to the JMS message data, the message in DLQ also has the expiration time that is the same as the original message. The expiry scanner will detect the DLQ message expires and remove it. That's why the message is lost after restart.
3. Actually, the message to DLQ is not completely the same as the origial message. Because the expiration time will be reset to 0 and some more message properties will be added. The DLQ message should not reuse the same reference to message data. For more details, please refer to org.apache.activemq.broker.region.RegionBroker.sendToDeadLetterQueue(ConnectionContext context, MessageReference node, Subscription subscription, Throwable poisonCause) method.

*Fixed Proposal*
In org.apache.activemq.broker.region.RegionBroker.sendToDeadLetterQueue(ConnectionContext context, MessageReference node, Subscription subscription, Throwable poisonCause) method, after the message is copied, set the dataLocator to null (message.getMessageId().setDataLocator(null) to force leveldb to save the new JMS message data and refer to a new position.","Windows, Linux Redhat",jira-bot,nevinchen,tabish,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"24/Nov/15 02:04;nevinchen;LevelDBStoreRecoveryBrokerTest.java;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12773965/LevelDBStoreRecoveryBrokerTest.java","24/Nov/15 01:54;nevinchen;activemq.xml;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12773959/activemq.xml",,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Tue Jan 12 17:00:51 UTC 2016,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2oucn:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"24/Nov/15 02:04;nevinchen;Test case to reproduce this issue.

{code:title=MBeanBridgeDestination.java|borderStyle=solid}
    private Map<ActiveMQDestination, ObjectName> destinationObjectNameMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<ActiveMQDestination, ObjectName>();
    private Map<ActiveMQDestination, NetworkDestinationView> outboundDestinationViewMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<ActiveMQDestination, NetworkDestinationView>();
    private Map<ActiveMQDestination, NetworkDestinationView> inboundDestinationViewMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<ActiveMQDestination, NetworkDestinationView>();
{code}

Both onOutboundMessage() and onInboundMessage() use the  destinationObjectNameMap to register the ObjectName of the NetworkDestinationView. But each other overwrite their value when using a duplex connection.

{code:title=MBeanBridgeDestination.java|borderStyle=solid}
public void onInboundMessage(Message message) {
....
 destinationObjectNameMap.put(destination, objectName);
}
{code}

When running with the option to purge unactiveDestinationViews which by default is active it will un-register from the MBeanServer the objectName that is found on  destinationObjectNameMap.remove(entry.getKey()); //ActiveMqDestination. This happens on the method purgeInactiveDestinationView(Map<ActiveMQDestination, NetworkDestinationView> map) which receives both outboundDestinationViewMap and inboundDestinationViewMap.

Thus when running for outboundDestinationViewMap if the last registration of a destination was actually of a inBound it will incorrectly delete  the object name of and  inboundDestination insead of the one from outboundDestination.

I expect it to work correctly, we have run this patch in production for a while and haven't seen the issue occur again so fingers crossed.;;;","15/Jan/16 14:04;tbain98;Can we back-port this issue to any future patch releases we do (5.13.1 at a minimum, plus 5.12.3, 5.11.4, etc. if we do them)?  I don't think it's important enough to make a patch version just for this issue, but I do think it's enough of a frustration for anyone with a NoB configuration that it should be in a patch release if we're already doing one for any of the earlier versions.;;;","15/Jan/16 14:14;tbain98;Also note that a workaround is to set the logging level to ERROR for org.apache.activemq.network.MBeanBridgeDestination.  You run the risk of not seeing errors in MBean creation due to other reasons, but in practice the odds of that are unlikely so there's really not much of a cost, and I think that's better than disabling JMX entirely.;;;","15/Jan/16 15:20;cshannon;I actually already backported this to 5.13.x but forgot to update the fixed versions.

Although disabling the log level on that class avoids the huge log output it still creates a performance impact during the time where the issue occurs until the next removal of destinations as for every message that is received being on that faulty state will enter the synchronization block and throw and exception which will cause performance to degrade.;;;","02/Feb/16 16:19;cshannon;Closing this as the fixes have been applied.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

feature:repo-add activemq 5.13-SNAPSHOT

The web console bundle is active and web:list shows:

62 | Active      | Deployed    | 80    | /activemqweb    | activemq-web-console (5.13.0.SNAPSHOT)

When I go to 
http://localhost:8181/activemqweb/

I get unable to connect. So the port is not active. Maybe pax web does not activate jetty because of the exception below.

In the log I see this exception:
ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource

Looks like this fix is causing a test failure in this test: org.apache.activemq.usecases.DurableSubscriberNonPersistentMessageTest.testDurableSubscriberNonPersistentMessage

It seems that the issue is the extra call node.incrementReferenceCount() in the createMessageDispatch() method of DurableTopicSubscription is causing the cursorMemoryUsage value checked in the test to no longer be 0.

yes, it makes sense to check security only on the class name without loading it. Thanks for that, I'll fix it on Monday. I'll need to check how XStream is doing it and if this problem exists there as well.

Why are the restrictions necessary?;;;","05/Dec/15 12:55;mbechler;Btw, you might want to have a look at your own org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient (as this is still on the whitelist). Have not checked under which conditition the static factory gets initialized exactly (it seems to be for the web console), but one can certainly do some mischief (I'd say mainly DOS) if it is.

I'd also suggest that you announce this change in a much more prominent way (maybe even get a CVE for it), as it both has very serious security implications if it goes unpatched and also very well might break some peoples code. And you should also make it very clear that one should be very careful what to add to the whitelist.

To answer Brett (as a third party):
Java deserialization on not completely trusted input is inherently dangerous. The amount of code reachable by just deseralizing some input is insane. There are many instances where developers are careless (or even simply don't care) what can be done with their deserialization routines (also there can be nasty interactions between different pieces of code) and the default deserialization routine allows one to use anything you have on your classpath. We have seen three major libraries contain code that leads to remote arbitrary code execution. And there are more to come.
Imho, we really need to either fix the primitive or drop it from all the specs that are/allow using it in potentially dangerous way.;;;","07/Dec/15 16:44;3riverdev;Fair enough on the reasoning -- makes sense.  However, I'd definitely agree that this fix needs to be announced through several channels, since it's a breaking change for many users.

Also consider supporting additional means to set org.apache.activemq.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES (other than a system property), perhaps through a ActiveMQComponent property, etc.

Additionally, provide logging on startup that communicates the restriction and how to customize it.;;;","08/Dec/15 10:27;dejanb;Hi Brett, yes we already discussed this on the dev list and decided to tackle this problem.

This eventually leads to ExceededMaximumConnectionsException being thrown from handleSocket. The SSL connection is aborted during handshake if needClientAuth is configured on the transport and a client with an invalid certificate tries to connect.

*Reproduction*
1. Enable the AMQP SSL transport: {{<transportConnector name=""amqp+ssl"" uri=""amqp+ssl://0.0.0.0:5671?needClientAuth=true&amp;maximumConnections=10""/>}}
2. Try to connect with no/invalid client certificate: {{openssl s_client -connect localhost:5671}}
3. After 10 attempts ActiveMQ logs will start showing ExceededMaximumConnectionsException exceptions.

*Bug*
During the SSL handshake phase the protocol converter in the AMQP transport is set to the AMQPProtocolDiscriminator which silently swallows exceptions:
{code:java}
public void onAMQPException(IOException error) {
}
{code}
Which in turn cause the normal stop sequence (via asyncStop) to be skipped.

*Fix*
Change the AMQPProtocolDiscriminator to handle the error instead of swallow it:
{code:java}
public void onAMQPException(IOException error) {
    transport.sendToActiveMQ(error);
}

Background

When multiple JVMs run AMQ in a master/slave configuration with the broker directory in a shared filesystem location (as is required e.g. for kahaPersistence), and when due to high message volume or slow producers the broker's memory needs exceed the configured memory usage limit, AMQ will overflow asynchronous messages to a PList store inside the ""tmp_storage"" subdirectory of said shared broker directory.

h4. Issue

We frequently observed this tmpDB store getting corrupted with ""stale NFS filehandle"" errors for tmpDB.data, tmpDB.redo, and some journal files, all of which suddenly went missing from the tmp_storage folder. This puts the entire broker into a bad state from which it cannot recover. Only restarting the service (which causes a broker slave to take over and loses the yet-undelivered messages) gets a working state back.

h4. Cause

During BrokerThread startup, the BrokerService.startPersistenceAdapter() method is called, which  via doStartPersistenceAdapter() and getProducerSystemUsage() invokes getSystemUsage(), that calls getTempDataStore(), and that method summarily cleans out the existing contents of the tmp_storage directory.
All of this happens *before* the broker lock is obtained in the PersistenceAdapter.start() method at the end of doStartPersistenceAdapter().

So a JVM that doesn't get to be the broker (because there already is one) and runs in slave mode (waiting to obtain the broker lock) interferes with and corrupts the running broker's tmp_storage and thus breaks the broker. That's a critical bug. The slave has no business starting up the persistence adapter and cleaning out data as it hasn't gotten the lock yet, so isn't allowed to do any work, period. 

h4. Workaround

As workaround, an unshared local directory needs to be specified as tempDirectory for the broker, even if the main broker directory is shared. Also, since broker startup will clear the tmp_storage out anyway, there really is no advantage to having this in a shared location - since the next broker that starts up after a broker failure will never re-use that data anyway.",RHLinux6,gtully,jira-bot,tabish,volkerk,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Thu Dec 10 15:52:52 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2mswf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12/Oct/15 13:27;tabish;Have you tested against the latest release, 5.10 is relatively old at this point.  ;;;","13/Oct/15 04:01;volkerk;Not yet - we have an AMQ 5.12 upgrade in the pipeline, but not in production use yet, and this problem is only reproduced in production use, since you need to create quite a few asynchronous topic messages to even get to use tmp_storage - while there's few messages they all stay in memory and this issue doesn't arise. Plus you need a multi-server environment. So this isn't easily reproduced in the lab.

However the relevant code has not changed in 5.12, I've verified that. It's all in one class and should be easy enough to follow the outline in the ticket description. I've added some additional detail to make it easier to follow.;;;","21/Oct/15 19:20;volkerk;Also, to replicate the source of the problem, you can simply hand-create empty tmpDB.data, tmpDB.redo, and db-1.log files in the shared tmp_storage folder, then restart one of the slave nodes while the master broker is still running - you will see that those files get deleted by the slave startup, which would corrupt the master broker's tmpDB if it were currently using it. So for issue replication it's not necessary to actually create enough asynchronous message load to be using tmp_storage - it's the tmpDB deletion by a *slave* that is the problem.

I should also note that we'd originally been seeing this in action only when using JDBC persistence (where there's technically no need for a shared dataDirectory at all anymore). With kahaPersistence things used to go south before ever reaching this point, due to unreliable file locking over NFS, so we've moved away from that.

The locked object is ENDED_XA_TRANSACTION_CONTEXTS in TransactionContext. The thread that has the lock calls afterRollback without first releasing it and afterRollback does not return promptly (not at all in fact, we need to restart the server to fix this). The same can happen with afterCommit, which is also called from within a synchronized block causing a potential deadlock.

I think I have a fix for this and will create a pull request in github, or if you prefer I can send a patch? It simply means moving the external calls out from the synchronized blocks and would both remove the very real deadlock risks and improve performance.",Platform independent,cshannon,erik.wramner,githubbot,gtully,jira-bot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"26/Sep/15 09:29;erik.wramner;edited-trace.txt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12762510/edited-trace.txt",,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Thu Oct 01 13:36:56 UTC 2015,,,,,,,Patch Available,,,,"0|i2k093:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10/Sep/15 16:51;githubbot;GitHub user erik-wramner opened a pull request:

;;;","20/Sep/15 13:57;cshannon;That patch might work but I'm a little concerned that the iteration of the list outside of a synchronization block could cause other issues such as concurrent modification exceptions if another thread tried to insert into the list.

Since this is only a partial thread dump, I am wondering why the afterRollback() call is never returning and stuck waiting for the MutexTransport write lock.  Is there an actual deadlock in that sense that the thread that has acquired the MutexTransport lock is waiting to acquire the ENDED_XA_TRANSACTION_CONTEXTS lock or is there some other reason why the MutexTransport lock can't be acquired? ;;;","20/Sep/15 18:40;erik.wramner;That is a valid point. I have changed the code so that it synchronizes on the list, keeping the global lock on the map short.

The thread with the MutexTransport is waiting for the communication channel to the broker to be reestablished. I'm not sure why that doesn't happen. It may be that the thread that should take care of that is blocked on the global map or it may be due to something else. We have two issues here. We are trying to sort out the communication issue with Red Hat. The broker is live and working, but obviously something is wrong.

However, even if everything had worked out the global lock must hurt performance. It makes all other threads working with other destinations and transactions wait for this specific thread and transaction to complete its afterCommit or afterRollback calls. That must hurt. And it may cause the server to hang as it does in this case.;;;","21/Sep/15 20:12;cshannon;Looks like the PR got closed again. 

And as you pointed out, we can look at seeing if it makes sense to get rid of the global lock for performance reasons.  But this specific bug in this case certainly seems to be that the afterRollback is stuck.  Even if you took away the locking, you'd have all of your threads stuck waiting forever for afterRollback to finish which would still cause the broker to quit working eventually.;;;","23/Sep/15 06:08;erik.wramner;Pull request 143 (https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/143) is open, 141 is closed.

As for all threads becoming stuck I don't agree for two reasons. First it might be that the thread that is supposed to reestablish communication is blocked on the locked HashMap. I don't know the code base well enough to easily find out, but I can dig into the stack trace. If that is the case we have a true deadlock and it would help to get rid of the global lock. Second even if afterRollback blocks forever that will kill one thread and one transaction, but without the global lock it may be possible for the other 169 threads to proceed with their work for new transactions (possibly for other queues/topics if the queue/topic is broken). They may also get blocked by other things, but it is possible that they can proceed. That could make the difference between a panic and a planned restart after peak times.

By the way, I changed the code again so that it doesn't lock the list when it has been removed from the map. Instead all additions to the list are within the map's lock. That way additions are protected and nothing can modify the list when it has been removed, so it can be processed safely without locks. That gets rid of the possible global lock in isInXATransaction, where the previous version locked the map and then tried to get a lock on the list.;;;","24/Sep/15 10:30;cshannon;[~gtully], Can you take a look at this when you get a chance to see what you think about the proposed changes of to the transactional behavior here? ;;;","25/Sep/15 15:31;gtully;[~erik.wramner] can you attach the full thread dump, just to determine why there is no response from the broker. thanks;;;","26/Sep/15 09:29;erik.wramner;Stack trace, application-specific package/class names replaced.;;;","28/Sep/15 15:49;gtully;peeking at the thread dump the root cause is: {code}at org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport.oneway(FailoverTransport.java:614){code}. There was a recent fix (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5951) in that area but there is also a workaround via timeout=1 for the failover transport.
The RAR does it's own reconnection and as a result the failover transport should not block on a reconnect and rather propagate the failure back to the caller, ie: maxReconnectAttempts=0 needs to be used on the failover url.
Peeking more at the fix, I think the canReconnect check may also be needed at line 609. Need to verify that.;;;","28/Sep/15 19:40;erik.wramner;I'm quite sure we were using maxReconnectAttempts=0, but not timeout=1. Good to know.

Still, unless you think the global lock is needed in order to ensure correctness somehow I would still argue for getting rid of it. It must hurt performance to make all the other threads wait for the afterCommit/afterRollback processing to complete and as illustrated here there is always a risk for liveness problems.;;;","30/Sep/15 10:52;gtully;I think the pull request looks fine and I see your point about liveness. The only issue is the lack of tests in this area and no additional test are included. However if you found some benefit in your use case it can make some sense to include this.
I can't see any point in holding the lock for callback processing from an transaction integrity point of view :-);;;","01/Oct/15 09:05;erik.wramner;Good. I like tests, but I can't see how I could write a good one for this. It happens after a few hours of heavy load. I guess I can mock it, but then the test would just work the way I intended...

We've found the cause and fixed it (oracle refused to fix their code), and would like you to add the fix to activemq so we can remove the local hack we've made. Look for the ""//new code"" in the code sample furthest down in this description

Cause: Oracle changed the method getQueueName() in weblogic.jms.common.DestinationImpl.java so that it returns null if the object received is not the correct type (a Topic instead of a Queue for instance). In previous version the method returned the name regardless of type. The missing name casues the bridge to fail. 

The object received in our case is an implementation of the Destination interface, DistributedDestinationImpl, which implements both these interfaces in its parent class DestinationImpl. In org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageTransformation.transformDestination(...) where the instanceof TemporaryQueue/TemporaryTopic++ tests will always return true for both TemporaryQueue and TemporaryTopic. The code will enter the first if() in the code below because of this and call the getQueueName() method even if it is a Topic, and will return null.  

ActiveMQMessageTransformation.java (old version): 
{code}
    public static ActiveMQDestination transformDestination(Destination destination) throws JMSException {
        ActiveMQDestination activeMQDestination = null;

        if (destination != null) {
            if (destination instanceof ActiveMQDestination) {
                return (ActiveMQDestination)destination;

            } else {
                if (destination instanceof TemporaryQueue) {
                    activeMQDestination = new ActiveMQTempQueue(((Queue)destination).getQueueName());
                } else if (destination instanceof TemporaryTopic) {
                    activeMQDestination = new ActiveMQTempTopic(((Topic)destination).getTopicName());
                } else if (destination instanceof Queue) {
                    activeMQDestination = new ActiveMQQueue(((Queue)destination).getQueueName());
                } else if (destination instanceof Topic) {
                    activeMQDestination = new ActiveMQTopic(((Topic)destination).getTopicName());

            }
        }

        return activeMQDestination;
    }

Because you got rid of getContentType(request), users who were specifying type with a request parameter would now break.  See http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html

There is an example on that page: {{wget --user admin --password admin http://localhost:8161/api/message/TEST?type=queue\&clientId=A\&json=true}} that would possibly not work since the json=true would no longer be checked.

Another issue is that request.getContentType() is supposed to be used to specify the content of the request, not to specify what the response type is.  The accept header is what should be used instead to specify what the response type is.

That being said, your point about the content type being set in the wrong spot is correct and should be called before response.getWriter().;;;","29/Nov/16 16:54;jira-bot;Commit f888cc2729832c6c71f0da9b5586d731e7a41648 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~davsclaus]

There appears to be an undocumented limitation of the broker component's current implementation. I need to know whether said limitation is by design or an oversight. If it's an oversight then I can submit a patch for it.

This example route does not work as expected - the JMSXGroupID header is lost when received by the broker component.

<route> 
<from uri=""broker:queue:test""/> 
<setHeader headerName=""JMSXGroupID""> 
<constant>123</constant> 
</setHeader> 
<to uri=""broker:queue:test""/> 
</route>

After single stepping with a debugger the component executes this code: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-camel/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/camel/component/broker/BrokerProducer.java#L102

As you can see from the method's implementation it only copies over a fixed set of six well-known headers. All other headers on the inbound message are discarded. Why not copy over every header? Consequently the JMSXGroupID header is not copied, despite being present on the inbound message.

This would appear to be a bug in my opinion as I do not believe we should be loosing any headers on a message in this case.

AMQ-5187 breaks some of our message routing where we use virtual queues to control mirroring/replication of messages.

A simple example...

{code}
VIRTUAL.PUB.ALL
-> queue://SUBSCRIBER1
-> queue://SUBSCRIBER2

VIRTUAL.PUB.SUBSCRIBER1
-> queue://SUBSCRIBER1
{code}

...fails [this assert|https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/f55edcfa25de1b55659a7113be60360c531ffa8a#diff-0def63df6ee6c0e4f8adcf00011b2f07R70] because there are two composite destinations that route to {{queue://SUBSCRIBER1}}. With asserts disabled messages are routed as expected.

I have attached a test case exemplifying this.

We use layers of composite queues to achieve explicit routing of messages to either one consumer or all consumers, and (also with static subscriptions) to target optimal routes across a mixture of LAN and WAN links.

Fully appreciate that subscription recovery from virtual topics of a mapped queue is a beneficial thing to do, however from our perspective it is also useful to retain the behaviour of being able to have a many-to-one mapping between composite queues and physical queues. For our own use case we don't have any requirement for subscription recovery - we require cast-iron guarantees around messaging so all messages persistent and are delivered to one or more physical queues on brokers with persistence enabled, so this obviates the need for subscription recovery.

Could this validation relaxed, could it be made possible for the new behaviour to be disabled or do you have any suggestions as to how else we could achieve our use case?

So what happens is that method getDestinationByName first gets a list of all the queue names. Then it iterates through them when meanwhile a queue gets deleted and thus throwing an exception. Fix should probably be in BrokerFacadeSupport:

{noformat}
        protected DestinationViewMBean getDestinationByName(Collection<? extends DestinationViewMBean> collection, String name) {
            Iterator<? extends DestinationViewMBean> iter = collection.iterator();

                DestinationViewMBean destinationViewMBean = iter.next();
                try {
                    String destName = destinationViewMBean.getName();
                    if (name.equals(destName)) {

This is a little tricky because we can't really add synchronization between the getQueues query and the actual getName() method call where it fails because many asynchronous processes can delete destinations.

It seems like the best thing to do here is to just catch the InstanceNotFoundException and continue checking the rest of the destinations in the list.  If the destination that was being queried was the one deleted then null would be returned which is the same behavior one would expect normally.

It works if we restart activeMQ, because then the configuration is not loaded by the runtimeConfigurationPlugin, however we really want to avoid that.

Solution: It seems that the translation from JAXB objects to ActiveMQ objects is not translating DtoFilteredDestination to FilteredDestinations in org.apache.activemq.plugin.JAXBUtils.

When I added the following code to the method ""inferTargetObject"", then the problem was solved:
{code}
        } else if (DtoFilteredDestination.class.isAssignableFrom(elementContent.getClass())) {
            return new FilteredDestination();
{code}

Why this matters: In my organisation we really like to use ActiveMQ VirtualDestinations with FilteredDestinations, because it is a much more minimalistic than having to make many simple subscriptions in Camel and it has many benefits compared to durable subscribers. However, we do not wish to restart ActiveMQ every time we modify the VirtualDestinations, hence we need to be able to updated the VirtualDestinations using runtimeConfigurationPlugin and this does not work right now due to this bug.

        if (!stopping.get() && !pendingStop) {
            transportException.set(e);
            if (TRANSPORTLOG.isDebugEnabled()) {

            }
            stopAsync(e);
        }

Sequence of events - 
1. The close() method on the ActiveMQConnection sends a ShutdownInfo to the server and immediately closes the socket from the client side. 
2. The broker's TcpTransportConnection is handling this ShutdownInfo but it so happens that the Inactivity monitor also fires off a write to the closed socket and fails with an EOFException or SocketException.
3. The public void stopAsync() in the org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.ManagedTransportConnection makes a call to unregister the MBeans and then sets the  stopping flag. The latency involved in unregistering the beans is causing the stopping flag to not be set in time, so the WARN message is caused. 

Moving the stopping flag to be set before the unregister bean call should set the stopping flag to be set and prevent the WARN message from being written to the log.

I have attached a patch a test.

I'm closing this out because this has been fixed already by one of the other 200 issues that apply to 5.12.0.

If necessary, I suppose we could use git-bisect to try and figure out which commit or commits fixed this issue and put it into the 5.11.x branch in case there is a 5.11.3 release.

The problem is that with a wild card topic, multiple destinations can be attached to the same store.  If one of the destinations is deleted and the other destinations are empty, the entire store is deleted.  This causes an exception later on if trying to do something like subscribe to a destination that wasn't deleted.  I've attached a test case to show this issue.  

The problem seems to be that the removeMessageStore method in MultiKahaDBPersistenceAdapter relies on adapter.getDestinations.isEmpty() to determine whether the store is eligible for deleting.  Unfortunately, the getDestinations method in KahaDBStore excludes destinations that are empty therefore the method doesn't return any destinations even though there is one still attached to the store so the logic goes ahead and deletes the store.

My first thought here is to simply update the getDestinations() method in KahaDBStore to include empty topics in the returned set.  The other PersistenceAdapter implementations don't seem to filter out empty topics so that would keep things consistent.

It appears that it is now re-creating demand for topics that have no durables. Something needs to gate that, or the other use case needs a different fix.

Test that shows the problem in a not so obvious way:
org.apache.activemq.usecases.ThreeBrokerVirtualTopicNetworkTest#testNetworkVirtualTopic


This needs a little revisit - but it turns out there were some negative consequences :-);;;","10/Jul/15 12:00;cshannon;[~gtully],

How do you feel about returning the getDestinations() method behavior to how it was previously but adding another method to the PersistenceAdapter called something like getAllDestinations() that would return empty destinations as well?  Or do the opposite and add a method called getDestinations(Filter) and then a filter could be used for the case of a network bridge to filter out empty topics.;;;","10/Jul/15 12:16;cshannon;I did a more thorough search and in AbstractRegion, getInactiveDestinations relies on destinationFactory.getDestinations().

;;;","10/Jul/15 15:01;gtully;thanks for the fast patch.
I am not sure we need another method because I think there should be enough there with org.apache.activemq.broker.Broker#getDurableDestinations
org.apache.activemq.broker.Broker#getDestinations
and:
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.DestinationFactory#getAllDurableSubscriptions

The difficult bit is tying down the usage to the correct method and ensuring consistency with the impls across the stores.

the network bridge only wants to create demand when org.apache.activemq.broker.region.DestinationFactory#getAllDurableSubscriptions is non empty, I think maybe it needs to use that method and maybe then the isEmpty check is negated and that method in kahadb can be more in line with others.
I need to research where that isEmpty check came from.
;;;","10/Jul/15 15:10;gtully;I think the root cause maybe is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2720 changing the impl of getDestinations;;;","10/Jul/15 16:12;gtully;I think org.apache.activemq.network.DurableConduitBridge#setupStaticDestinations needs to be reworked to query the topic region, I think it should be using its clientid and subname also in the match. ;;;","10/Jul/15 16:12;cshannon;So how do you feel about this fix:

We could pass the destinationFactory to the NetworkConnector object and then change the configureBridge method to check durableSubscriptions.

Then the loop iterating over the durableDestinations in configureBridge around line 140 or so could be changed from:
 {{if(d.isTopic())}} to {{if(d.isTopic() && destinationFactory.getAllDurableSubscriptions((ActiveMQTopic)d).length > 0)}};;;","10/Jul/15 16:35;cshannon;[~gtully],

I think your proposed fix of changing DurableConduitBridge makes more sense than mine.  I will create a new PR with the fix and submit it shortly.  I will include the expanded unit tests that I had in my other PR.;;;","10/Jul/15 16:43;githubbot;Github user cshannon closed the pull request at:

I am investigating an issue where in if the Database goes down we get closed connection errors for transactions through AMQ.

The setup we have is as per below:

Websphere 8557
AMQ 5.10.2
Datastore (SIBUS) for message persistence - oracle database

Just would like to know, if this issue talks about the same problem we are facing?

Any advice will be highly appreciated.

I would be hesitent to change the default behavior to always clear out the text because then a call to {{getText}} on a TextMessage would require an additional decoding of the content.;;;","29/Jun/15 18:02;graben;Well, do you think anyone would call getText() anymore after calling setText()? I think calling storeContentAndClear() is not a good solution esspecially if your using JMS API (eg. camel-jms) and do not want to depend on ActiveMQ proprietary API. Why not use storeContentAndClear in beforeMarshall()?;;;","29/Jun/15 18:55;cshannon;You do make a good point about storeContentAndClear not being a great solution if you want to stick with a pure JMS client.  I wouldn't expect getText() to be called too often but I could see it being useful in some cases like if a client was logging full messages before or after a send.  

[~tabish121], What do you think? I could go either way on this. ;;;","29/Jun/15 22:02;tabish;I don't think it'd be a bad thing if the message cleared the content on marshal, however, it is possible that this could have some unintended consequences.  The broker and the client both share this code and on the client side it probably works fine, on the broker side there could be cases where we might see something go wrong when things like concurrent store and dispatch is enabled so changing this bit should be thoroughly tested.  ;;;","29/Jun/15 22:57;cshannon;Coming from the broker side, this change actually makes more sense to me as messages will be in memory longer term than a typical client where they go out of scope after being sent and are eligible for GC.

I can start testing this out tomorrow and see if anything obvious breaks (ie run through the full test suite, etc);;;","12/Jul/15 19:29;graben;Any test results yet?;;;","13/Jul/15 12:09;cshannon;Sorry, got side tracked a bit the past couple of weeks.  So, I ran through some tests locally and everything looked ok.  A full run on the CI server would still be needed though as some of the tests are unreliable when run locally for me so I'd want to run it on the CI server to make sure.

I guess I would defer to [~tabish121] on this.  Tim, do you think running through the existing test suite and seeing if anything fails is good enough for testing?;;;","13/Jul/15 15:24;tabish;I think that should show if there is an impact.  I think the change is safe other than the risk that the broker logs a message an causes the content to become unmarshaled which could cause compressed content to no longer be compressed but that seems unlikely.  ;;;","13/Jul/15 16:00;githubbot;GitHub user cshannon opened a pull request:

Fixing a potential race condition in the storeContent
method of ActiveMQTextMessage
;;;","31/Jul/15 18:50;cshannon;There was a race condition in the storeContext() method of ActiveMQTextMessage where in between checking the text field for null and writing the content of text to the stream, the text field was set to null.  A fix has been applied that caches the reference to the text string locally in the method to prevent having to synchronize.  I also tweaked a couple other methods with a similar change to prevent the same issue.

CamelVmTransportRoutingTest is now passing again.  I will double check with Jenkins tomorrow to make sure the test failure has been cleared up.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

                In the log we got 15 warnings :

                But one message is not rolled back (the transaction commit) and is also redileverd to another consummer. So it's processed twice by two different consummers (two inserts in database and two output JMS messages generated) and is not deduplicated.

Our analysis :

                We think that the duplicate message is caused by the failover during the prepare phase of the commit so we modify the source code to reproduce the case.

                Our modifications in config to produce failovers:
                               broker : transport.useKeepAlive=false
                               client : wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=5000


                We add Thread.sleep in the source code of org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer to force failover to be done exactly where we think it causes problems :

{code:title=org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer#acknowledge()|borderStyle=solid}                

                    public void acknowledge() throws JMSException {
                               clearDeliveredList();
                               waitForRedeliveries();
                               synchronized(deliveredMessages) {

                                       Thread.sleep(1000 * 20 );
                                   }catch (InterruptedException e){
                                       LOG.error(""Exception :"",e);
                                   }

                                   MessageAck ack = makeAckForAllDeliveredMessages(MessageAck.STANDARD_ACK_TYPE);
                                   if (ack == null)
                                       return; // no msgs

                                   if (session.getTransacted()) {
                                       rollbackOnFailedRecoveryRedelivery();
                                       session.doStartTransaction();
                                       ack.setTransactionId(session.getTransactionContext().getTransactionId());
                                   }

                                   pendingAck = null;
                                    session.sendAck(ack);

                                   // Adjust the counters
                                   deliveredCounter = Math.max(0, deliveredCounter - deliveredMessages.size());
                                   additionalWindowSize = Math.max(0, additionalWindowSize - deliveredMessages.size());

                                   if (!session.getTransacted()) {
                                       deliveredMessages.clear();
                                   }
                               }
                    }
{code}                               
                
                With these changes on the configuration and the code, the problem is easily reproduced.

                We also try with transactedIndividualAck=true, and we add a Thread.sleep in the code :

{code:title=org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer#registerSync()|borderStyle=solid}                
                    private void registerSync() throws JMSException {
                               session.doStartTransaction();
                               if (!synchronizationRegistered) {
                                   synchronizationRegistered = true;
                                   session.getTransactionContext().addSynchronization(new Synchronization() {
                                       @Override
                                       public void beforeEnd() throws Exception {
                                           if (transactedIndividualAck) {
                                               clearDeliveredList();

                With these modifications, we still get duplicates messages.

                We think that the problem is that the statement synchronized(deliveredMessages) prevents the call of clearDeliveredList() by another ActiveMQConnection thread that clears messages in progress.
                By adding logs we observe that a thread is waiting deliveredMessages ‘s lock in clearDeliveredList() method.

                
Question :
                
                We tried fixes described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5068 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3519 but it doesn’t help to solve our problem.
                Is there a workaround or a config parameter that can help to prevent this problem ?
                
                We are working on our side to find a correction. An option may be to force rolling back transaction if there is a failover during the prepare phase of commit in ConnectionStateTracker.restoreTransactions().


","Ubuntu or AIX

In the AMQ-2590 issue, only one phase commit transactions are rolled back in case of failover.

We change the ConnectionStateTracker code (in 5.10.2) to rollback others type of transaction (BEGIN and PREPARE).


{code:title=org.apache.activemq.state.ConnectionStateTracker.java|borderStyle=solid}
    private void restoreTransactions(Transport transport, ConnectionState connectionState) throws IOException {
        Vector<TransactionInfo> toRollback = new Vector<TransactionInfo>();
        for (TransactionState transactionState : connectionState.getTransactionStates()) {
            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                LOG.debug(""tx: "" + transactionState.getId());
            }

            // rollback any completed transactions - no way to know if commit got there
            // or if reply went missing
            //
            if (!transactionState.getCommands().isEmpty()) {
                Command lastCommand = transactionState.getCommands().get(transactionState.getCommands().size() - 1);
                if (lastCommand instanceof TransactionInfo) {
                    TransactionInfo transactionInfo = (TransactionInfo) lastCommand;
                    if (transactionInfo.getType() == TransactionInfo.COMMIT_ONE_PHASE
                            // BEGIN MODIFIED CODE					
                            || transactionInfo.getType() == TransactionInfo.BEGIN
                            || transactionInfo.getType() == TransactionInfo.PREPARE
                            // END MODIFIED CODE							
                            ) {
                        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                            LOG.debug(""rolling back potentially completed tx: "" + transactionState.getId());
                        }
                        toRollback.add(transactionInfo);
                        continue;
                    }
                }
            }
{code}

With this change we can not reproduce our duplicated messages issue.

Is there a specific reason why only one phase transactions are rolled back in AMQ-2590 ?

We are working on our side to provide a test case to reproduce the duplicated message issue.

Thanks.;;;","10/Aug/15 17:07;nannou9;Hi Michael!

1st of all thank you for your work you've done so far, it is very helpful.

So basing on your work, I was able to reproduce the problem with Atomikos 3.9.26 (which include important fix for rollback to fail) but also confirmed this problem to occur with Apache Geronimo transaction manger.
This proves that problem is purely ActiveMQ related.
I've also tested JBoss A-MQ 6.1 (5.9 based) and 6.2 (5.11 based)- all affected with same problem!

What is important to say here is that this problem will occur significantly more often on slow envs which prone to freeze/restart (virtual machines especially).

Let's see now what will happen and whether someone will grab that task.

Thanks
;;;","03/Sep/15 13:58;hakim.acharifi;In order to reproduce the AMQ5854 issue, we have created a maven project amq5854 (see the attached amq5854.tar.gz).

The abnormal behavior has been reproduced in 2 versions of AMQ : 5.10.2 and 5.11.1

The goal is to feign an overloaded CPU by modifying the activemq-client-xxx.jar with a sleep of 20 seconds during the consumption of the message.

Prerequisites to be able to reproduce the abnormal behavior :
-	Consumer : failover, wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=5000 and RedeliveryPolicy with a maximumRedeliveries of 3 times
-	Broker : transport.useKeepAlive=false
-	activemq-client-xxx.jar : add Thread.sleep(20*1000) on the org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer (see the attached sources) 


Use case :
 
A producer send a message to the INPUT_QUEUE queue on an embedded broker.
Then a consumer implemented by a Spring Listener consume this message from the INPUT_QUEUE, transform it and send it to another queue (OUTPUT_QUEUE).
The read from INPUT_QUEUE and the write to OUTPUT_QUEUE are included in a same transaction XA.

With the activemq-client modification, the consumption of the message is superior of 20 seconds and the maxInactivatyDuration for the consumer is 5 seconds.
Hence, we will be always in the case where an InactivityIOException prevent the arrival of the message on the OUTPUT_QUEUE because of the rollback transaction request.
So the expected result is to have 1 message in DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) and no message in the OUTPUT_QUEUE.
But due to the abnormal behavior, Activemq do not rollback the write on the OUTPUT_QUEUE. 
So After 3 retries,  we have 1 message on DLQ and  3 duplicate messages on the OUTPUT_QUEUE.

If the commit request gets a failure then it is impossible to know if the message got there or if the reply was lost so notifying the client is the only option. Otherwise failover can try and recreate the transaction state and allow it to complete.
In hindsight, trying to maintain transaction semantics across failover (especially in the context of multiple consumers) seems too complex.
I want to investigate the fix for this issue and see if it is better to implement the fix or remove this feature altogether and just rollback any indoubt transaction on failover.;;;","28/Sep/15 13:41;jira-bot;Commit 8d982479e9a5579fc3f6da04109a1b3ef69431eb in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5854 - fix and test. Ensure transaction rollback if there are pending acks during a failover reconnect. Reliably tracking pending acks to eusure possible redelivery is too complex in the context of acks getting dropped by failover or ignored by the subscription, in addition to being sent async. Couple that with multiple consumers on the same connection and the locking of message delivery; only safe course is to ensure rollback outcome.
;;;","28/Sep/15 14:13;gtully;I have implemented a rollback only option on the transaction context that is triggered by a failover, the initial disconnect that will trigger a reconnect.

There is a new unit test that simulates a delayed or slow ack, consumer side, with an additional transaction synchronization and can reliably reproduce the missed ack.;;;","28/Sep/15 14:43;nannou9;Excellent news!

Sorry in advance for the long message but this is a kind of complicated issue and was pretty hard to track down.

There is a race condition of sorts and it is caused by the unique circumstances of this test case and the environment.  The short version is that message acks are being received out of order due to messages being handled concurrently in different threads.  Sometimes this causes an exception because by the time some of the acks are received by the broker, the broker has already expired the messages so the acknowledgement check fails.  This is happening in Wildfly because the container is creating a pool of threads to handle multiple messages at the same time (ie ServerSession pool).  This is unique to application servers because of the use of a ConnectionConsumer and ServerSessions so multiple threads can handle messages from 1 consumer.

What's going on is as a message producer is sending messages to the broker with a TTL value set at 10 milliseconds, the Wildfly consumer is quickly dequeing messages in parallel.  The run() method in ActiveMQSession is being executed for each new message in different threads.  The first thing that happens is the message is checked to see if it has expired (around line 885 of ActiveMQSession).  If it's not expired, then the code continues on and the messageListener (in this case the MDB) eventually runs (around line 1037). The example that was submitted here has the MDB sleeping for 1 second which is  longer than the TTL of the messages being sent.  So a bunch of threads are sleeping for 1 second and then when they are finished the run() method continues on and at the end sends a normal acknowledgement back to the broker in the finally block (around line 1052)

However, as the ConnectionConsumer is rapidly consuming more messages and dispatching to different Sessions, eventually one of the threads runs into a message that is expired because the time out period is so short.  Since the message is expired, it is acked early and sent to the broker.  The MDB never fires when the message is expired.   This triggers the broker to iterate through all of the dispatched messages and to expire ones that it can.  This happens in the PrefetchSubscription class around line 325 when an expired Ack is received.  So, all of the messages that were dispatched essentially get removed from that dispatch list since all of the messages are expired.  Then, when some of the threads in Wildfly finish sleeping they continue on and get around to sending back an ack.  Except that by the time this acknowledgement is sent to the broker, the messages have already been expired because the thread that detected the expired message already sent an expired ack to the broker so the message attempting to be acked doesn't exist in the dispatched list.

Below is a printout from my log file with some extra debug statements that I added.  The ""handling message"" line is a debug statement that I added to print right after a message is dequeued in the run() method.  You can see multiple threads executing at the same time in Wildfly.  ""Expired Message"" prints out when a message is detected as being expired. ""Sending Ack"" prints out when the thread finishes the normal execution and sends a normal ack back to the broker.  As you can see below, we run into trouble when the thread handling the 4th message finishes and sends an acknowledgement to the broker.  During the period of time that the thread handling message 4 was sleeping for 1 second, 13 other messages were handled in parallel.  Just before thread 4 finished, one of the other threads had detected that message 13 expired and sent back an expiration ack which triggered all of the acks to be expired(including message 4) so by the time the ack for the 4th message reached the broker that message was already removed from the dispatch list and we get an exception.

So, as far as solutions go, I'm not sure what the best approach would be.  This situation could happen anytime messages are processed slowly in parallel and there is a TTL set.  Obviously one work around is to not concurrently process messages off the same subscription but that is pretty common with MDBs and application servers.  One solution could be to check a second time to see if the message has expired after the messageListener has been called and send an expired ack instead of a normal ack in that case.  But we'd need to change the server logic to not fail if it couldn't find the message to ack because it was already expired.  I think another solution could be to keep track of of which messages have already been expired on a subscription for some window of time so that so that if an acknowledgement comes later it could be detected as being for an expired message and no error would be thrown.  What do you guys thing?  I can work on a PR and introduce a fix but wanted to discuss what you thought would be the best approach.

;;;","23/Jun/15 11:46;gtully;[~christopher.l.shannon] great detail ;-). Seems that the broker reaction to the expiredAck is excessive. maybe that should be treated as a single/individual ack and just remove the single message that has expired, it can check the count attribute to ensure it should match a single message. Currently in prefetchsub there is a check on all dispatched messages which seems excessive in this scenario. I think that is the crux of the problem.

For a long time, there was no message expiry processing thread so the only checks were on dispatch, it seems when there is periodic expiry some of the additional checks are candidates from removal.;;;","23/Jun/15 14:13;cshannon;It seems like switching the logic to only remove the message or messages that the ack refers to might be the best way to go.

I had run through a bunch of tests already that I could find relating to expired messages and they had passed but of course there are a lot of tests.  The JMSConsumerTest seems like a good one to run for a sanity check though.

This can go wrong if the bundle uses dynamic imports like e.g. jline does. In this case the jline bundle is triggered to load classes from ActiveMQ. This establishes a wiring from jline to ActiveMQ. If the ActiveMQ bundle are now refreshed or uninstalled jline also has to be refreshed which triggers refreshs of a lot more bundles.

I propose to replace the class probing with checking of the bundle requirements. We simply check if the bundle has an import for the packages of the interface classes of ActiveMQ. So we avoid triggering classloading and the creation of unwanted wirings.

The goal is not to verify that the bundle actually imports *some* known packages, but the fact that the bundle imports *our* package.

Failover Transport - Sleep for Reconnect Delay happens twice per iteration,AMQ-5819,12834644,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

To reproduce:
- start a jms client with brokerUrl: failover:(tcp://hostname:61616)?randomize=false&warnAfterReconnectAttempts=1
- turn on debug logging for logger 'org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport'
- Once the application has connected, stop the broker on hostname


While the broker is down, observe the logs from org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport, and you will see the following pattern for each iteration:

=====================
WARN - Failed to connect to [tcp://hostname:61616] after: n attempt(s) continuing to retry.
DEBUG - Waiting <reconnectDelay> ms before attempting connection
-- sleep happens here
DEBUG - urlList connectionList:[tcp://hostname:61616], from: [tcp://hostname:61616]
DEBUG - Waiting <reconnectDelay> ms before attempting connection
--- sleep happens here
DEBUG - Attempting  nth  connect to: tcp://hostname:61616
DEBUG - Connect fail to: tcp://hostname:61616, reason: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect
=====================

The above sequence is repeated for as long as the broker is down, with the exponent applied to the reconnectDelay in between the above two instances of sleep. In the configuration above, once the maxReconnectDelay is reached (30 seconds) it is actually 1 minute between attempts to reconnect to the broker. Log output with timestamps is shown below, and you can see that it is 1 minute between attempting the 13th connection and attempting to 14th connection, even though maxReconnectDelay is 30 seconds:

AMQ version is 5.12.1.
Sometimes IOException occurs (we use windows net drive and we had slow disk on our VM and a lot of persistent messages) which blocks the broker.

KahaDB property enableIndexWriteAsync is setted to TRUE. In case of IOException ""KahaDB Page Writer"" thread dies so it blocks """"ActiveMQ Journal Checkpoint Worker"" thread which waits for CountDownLatch (in PageFile.flush) which will never countDown.

note the default behaviour is to stop the broker in such an event via the IOExceptionHandler.

It would be great to find the original jstack, because the restarted checkpoint thread is most probably attempting to get the write lock which is the trigger. In any event, having a global transaction store lock is a remnant of an old fix and is broken.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have pushed up a pull request to fix this issue and included your test case in the patch to make sure that the issue stays fixed.

[~tabish121],

Can you take a look and make sure it looks ok?  It seemed like a very simple fix but I just want to make sure what I changed wouldn't have any unintended consequences.  I ran through some of the tests relating to AMQ-5160 and they all still seemed to pass.  I'm running through all the tests right now but that will take a while to finish.;;;","02/Jul/15 12:55;tabish;I was testing a similar fix last night, guess I should have assigned this one to myself to avoid duplication of effort, oops.  So I made basically the same change although I tried to ensure that a valid context was always passed along by checking that the context in the sub was non-null and using the pass in context if none was supplied in the subscription.

{code}
        ConnectionContext originalContext = sub.getContext() != null ? sub.getContext() : context;
{code}

From a run of the tests with this change I didn't see any new failures so I don't think there are any hidden surprises.  If you want to update your PR and do some additional sanity checks we can just push that.

I also created a simpler OpenWire only test since this actually affects any client connection which I will show below:

This works fine for Durables and Queues (Prefetch subscriptions) where the value is a positive value when it can accept more messages.  Usually the value will report the size of prefetch minus any prefetch extension and dispatchedQueueSize.

However, for a {{TopicSubscription}} this value is reversed and it is subtracting prefetch from dispatchedQueueSize.  For example, if the prefetch policy is set at 1000, this method will report ""-1000"" when calling countBeforeFull.",,cshannon,githubbot,tabish,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Fri Jun 05 18:13:57 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2fbb3:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28/May/15 11:37;githubbot;GitHub user cshannon opened a pull request:

These TIME_WAIT sockets are fluctuating from thousand (like 2000-3000) to 1 in every 2-3 minutes of interval.


Following are the steps to reproduce this issue:

*Step-1).* Configure AMQ broker to listen on ""61621"" then start it.

*Step-2).* Deploy the ""activemq-rar.rar""  (5.9 vesion) to standalone instance of JBoss EAP 6.3 and use the attached ""standalone-full.xml"" file to start the EAP6.3 as ot has the resource-adapter configuration in it.
 {code}
    cd jboss-eap-6.3.0/bin
   ./standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
{code}

*Step-3).* Deploy the a simple MDB based application like an EAR containing around 20 MDBs listening to 20 different queues present on the A-MQ side. All these MDBs are very simple MDBs and just displays the received TextMessages. These MDBs have the following annotations in it (see maxSessions = 1).

{code}
@MessageDriven(activationConfig={@javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""destination"", propertyValue=""java:/jms/queue1/1.0""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""useJndi"", propertyValue=""true""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""destinationType"", propertyValue=""javax.jms.Queue""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""acknowledgeMode"", propertyValue=""Auto-acknowledge""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""maximumRedeliveries"", propertyValue=""6""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""initialRedeliveryDelay"", propertyValue=""5000""), @javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName=""maxSessions"", propertyValue=""1"")})

.
.
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        TextMessage textMessage = (TextMessage) message;
        try {
            log.info(""SimpleMdb1 received a message"" + textMessage.getText());
        }
        catch (JMSException e) {
            log.info(""Error in SimpleMdb1 while received a message"");
        }
    }
{code}

*Step-4).* Execute the following command and notice around thousand TCP connections as following:

{code}

This seems to be a different issue. This issue occurs in one of our several AMQ environments and cannot be replicated anywhere else.

I can go with the upgrade if I can find a root cause of the issue and for sure know that 5.11.1 will fix it as an AMQ upgrade in our environment is non trivial.
The issue again occurred yesterday and the thread dumps from yesterday tell the same story. If you need any activemq logs either in trace/debug mode I will be able to attach them here.

I am going through the ActiveMQ source code to corner this issue. Any pointers/help in this regard is greatly appreciated.;;;","26/May/15 11:59;cshannon;Yes, I think you are right that it is different.  At first glance it looked like the same issue based on the addMessageLast thread being the same.  The patch I suggested helps with timing out while waiting to add a message on a store, but this is different. 

Based on your thread dump, the NIO worker has acquired the {{messagesLock}} in the {{sendMessage}} method of the Queue class (line 1853 in the Queue.java) and is waiting on the intrinsic lock of FilePendingMessageCursor on the {{addMessageLast}} method (line 207 in FilePendingMessageCursor.java).  The BrokerService thread has acquired the intrinsic lock of FilePendingMessageCursor in {{onUsageChanged}} (line 394 of FilePendingMessageCursor.java)  and is waiting on {{messagesLock}} in the {{messageExpired}} method (line 1841 of Queue.java)....a pretty classic deadlock.  In version 5.11.1 some of this has been refactored a bit, {{sendMessage}} method has been replaced with {{cursorAdd}}, etc.  However, at a glance I think the deadlock issue would still exist in 5.11.1.

Tim, do you think it would be worth replacing the {{messagesLock.writeLock().lock()}} calls with {{messagesLock.writeLock().tryLock()}} and handle the lock timeout to prevent a potential deadlock?


;;;","08/Mar/16 15:41;gtully;it looks like the onUsageChanged of the filecursor needs to remove expired messages from the cursor and then process them as expired *without* holding the cursor lock.

messages.  ;;;","08/Mar/16 18:54;cshannon;[~gtully] , Good idea, I meant to come back to this issue and take a closer look at solving it but it got lost in the backlog. :);;;","26/Oct/16 08:38;mkubricht;Reviewing the commit I found that it introduces new mistake.
I believe that commit solves the deadlock problem, but...

It breaks original implementation of method {{expireOldMessages()}} which is:
# still used by other methods - {{tryAddMessageLast(MessageReference, long)}}, {{addMessageFirst(MessageReference)}}
# protected, so potentially used by extending classes

Problem caused by changing {{expireOldMessages()}} is that it breaks the functionality of freeing space when adding new messages to the cursor. Currently after this fix it only creates a an unnecessary load of expired messages to the list which is never used.

Commenting on these lines in code (which are shared by both addMessageX methods):
{code}
  if (!hasSpace()) {
    if (isDiskListEmpty()) {
      expireOldMessages(); // this will not clear anything!
      if (hasSpace()) { // this probably won't happen
        memoryList.addMessageFirst(node);
        node.incrementReferenceCount();
        return;
      } else { // will always fallback to flushing data to disk
        flushToDisk();
      }
    }

Recently I've faced with weird problem, actually I'm not sure if it's a bug or misconfiguration or something else. But since my broker has ""almost"" default configuration I think this is bug.
Brief configuration description(full configuration xml file at the end of issue):
- Persistent storage: MySQL Db
- Message type: only persistent Text Messages 
- Subscribers: only durable topic subscribers

So, when I started broker I monitored its cpu/memory usage and here is what I noticed, memory chart below:(for servers monitoring I'm using New Relic):
[Heap Memory Chart | http://s4.postimg.org/fjiwg1v0d/amq_memory_leak_chart.png]
As you can see usage of memory slowly but constantly growing.
I decided to find out what exactly stored in activemq's heap, so I dumped heap and analyzed it with Eclipse MAT. Screenshots below:
[Leak Analysis | http://s4.postimg.org/nqaw7ml31/amq_leak_suspect.png]
As we can see almost all of the memory occupied in JournalTopicMessageStore. Going deeper:
[First heapdump | http://s4.postimg.org/p6r03iddp/amq_problem_suspect_00_00.png]
We can see *completions* list in TransactionContext, which has size of 38590 objects. This heap dump I made at 00:00.
Below is a heap dump that I made 4 hours later:
[Second heapdump | http://s4.postimg.org/e8fqlbosd/amq_problem_suspect_04_00.png]

The picture is the same, but now this list contains 63770 objecs.
Analyzed code a little bit, I noticed that this list is never cleared and hence its size always growth. Runnables that are stored in this list have link to Message object and hence this message is never will be GC'ed, even after ActiveMQ puts it to db. Of course I don't know probably this is a regular behavior that objects from this list are never removed, but it's looks really strange that object that contains this list is never recreated for 10 hours.

Also the activemq-web-console war bundle embed several jars which shouldn't bethere. Per the best practice of OSGi, a bundle should import and use the classes installed in the OSGi container already and avoid embedding classes. 

And there's the split-package issue exist in activemq-web-console bundle.

The queue has a cursor high memory water mark set (right now at 70%).  When a producer is producing messages quickly to the queue and that limit gets hit, the broker can deadlock.   I have tried setting producerWindowSize and alwaysSyncSend which did not seem to help. When the broker hits that limit, I am unable to do things like purge the queue.  Consumers can also deadlock as well. 

Note that this appears to be the same issue as described in this ticket here: AMQ-2475 .  The difference is that I am using a Queue and not a Topic and the fix for this appears to only have been for Topics.

The problem appears to be in the Queue class on line 1852 inside the {{cursorAdd}} method.  The method being called is {{return messages.addMessageLast(msg);}} which will block indefinitely if there is no space available, which in turn ties up the {{messagesLock}} from being used by any other threads.  We have seen a deadlock where consumers can't consume because they are waiting on this lock.   It looks like in AMQ-2475 part of the fix was to replace {{messages.addMessageLast(msg)}} with {{messages.tryAddMessageLast(msg, 10)}}.  I also noticed that not all of the message cursors support {{tryAddMessageLast}}, which could be a problem.  {{FilePendingMessageCursor}} implements it but the rest of the cursors (notably {{StoreQueueCursor}}) simply delegate back to {{addMessageLast}} in the parent class.  So part of this fix may require implementing {{tryAddMessageLast}} across more cursors.


Here is part of the thread dump showing the stuck producer:

This seems to fix the issues that I am having.  Without the patch, the broker would deadlock (I could not purge, etc) when the temp store limit was hit for non-persistent messages for both sync and async sends and also both when sendFailIfNoSpace is true or false.  

With this patch, I am able to purge and no longer have deadlock issues.  For async sends, if {{sendFailIIfNoSpace}} is false the producer will block but I can purge and then the producer resumes.  I {{sendFailIfNoSpace}} is true, exceptions are logged to the broker and I can still purge.  For non-persistent sync sends, if {{sendFailIIfNoSpace}} is false the producer will block but I can purge and then the producer resumes.  I {{sendFailIfNoSpace}} is true, the producer gets an exception which is what should happen.

Let me know if this looks ok. I looked at what was done for Topics in AMQ-2475 and I tried to follow the same strategy. I can also try and add a test or 2 if needed.;;;","08/Apr/15 19:14;tabish;I general it's a good idea to add some unit tests that cover the problem you are trying to address, this provides context to the person reviewing the patch, and protects the fix into the future.  ;;;","08/Apr/15 19:28;cshannon;[~tabish121], sounds good.  I don't have time today but tomorrow morning I will try and get some tests together to cover this fix.  I'll push up my change to my branch when I am done.;;;","09/Apr/15 21:54;tabish;I believe I've run into this while doing some testing for AMQP flow control issues.  Once I did some debugging I remembered this issue while looking into the stack traces.  ;;;","09/Apr/15 22:14;cshannon;I started working on a unit test today to replicate this issue but I haven't quite been able to reproduce the bug in a unit test yet.  In my simple unit test (just one producer), when the temp storage fills the broker detects this at line 821 of {{Queue.java}} when {{checkUsage(context, producerExchange, message);}} is called.

When I run our real broker, it gets past that line until it hits the {{cursorAdd}} method and ultimately gets stuck spinning in {{FilePendingMessageCursor.java}} on line 235 at {{if (systemUsage.getTempUsage().waitForSpace(maxWaitTime))}}

Our broker is configured for persistent messaging, but the producer is sending non-persistent messages which is why the temp store is used.  I'll continue to try and put a test together next week or figure out what's different about my set up.  We have some custom code that we are using so it could be that or it could just be our configuration. (Maybe something in the Queue Policy that we have configured)  What I do know is that when I apply my pull request it fixes the dead lock and the broker no longer gets stuck on line 235 of {{FilePendingMessageCursor.java}};;;","13/Apr/15 16:40;cshannon;Timothy,

I just pushed up my updated [pull request|https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/84/] with a unit test.  If you run the test before my patch, it will timeout because of a deadlock.  With my patch applied it completes successfully.  The key in this test to making it deadlock is the issue only occurs when the temporary storage size is configured to be less than the memory storage size.  (such as 4 gig of memory storage and 1 gig of temp storage).  While this configuration probably isn't too likely, it's still a possibility.  When memory fills up and it is dumped to disk, the deadlock occurs and the queue can not be purged.  My unit test demonstrates this.

Also, I still think there other conditions that cause the broker to deadlock in the same spot (in one of our servers this has happened and the temporary storage was greater than memory size) but this unit test was the easiest way I could reproduce the problem reliably.

Let me know what you think,
Chris

;;;","13/Apr/15 17:50;tabish;Thanks for the patch, I had uncovered much the same, in my testing and have a smaller but similar test case using the AMQP test client.  The issue occurs due to a race when the temp store is initialize by a change in memory usage that trips the limit causing the in memory message to need to be sent to disk.  The problem is that in the Queue send we don't see that temp storage is full yet and try to do the add.  While your fix does work around this is would result in the lose of the message(s) that arrive while this is happening which is not something we would want to do in the case of a Queue which has specific QOS guarantees.  

I am taking a look at how things work today and rethinking some of the layering of add vs tryAdd as it seems a bit wrong to me and can lead to this sort of error in more than one case as you have pointed out.  ;;;","13/Apr/15 18:12;paulgale;Perhaps I've missed something but if you're working with non-persistent messages then why not configure a policyEntry for the queue to use a vmCursor rather than the default storeCursor? 

Regardless, I agree that the temp store's implementation needs some work. Ideally it should honor the sendFailIfNoSpaceAfterTimeout when configured on the systemUsage element.;;;","13/Apr/15 18:16;cshannon;Great, thanks for your help and for taking a look this issue in detail as it is very important to us and it is causing us a lot of problems.  I suspected my patch may not be the best solution and would need some rework because when the tryAdd method times out with my patch nothing is actually done with that message.  After returning false it just continues on and the message gets lost as you pointed out.  However, I figured submitting something that at least demonstrated the issue as well as a unit test where it is consistently reproducible would help get things started towards finding the best solution to fix the issue permanently.

Chris;;;","13/Apr/15 18:23;cshannon;[~paulgale], Our issue is that we occasionally have slow consumers which fill up our entire memory store (and temporary store) which is causing the deadlock.  This is the reason we can't use the vmCursor as we need to be able to spill over onto to disk when the memory store fills up.  Also, in our case the jms producer is setting the delivery mode as non-persistent (so the temp store gets used), but it could just as easily switch to persistent.  We want the queue to be set up so the producer can decide if it wants to publish persistent or non persistent messages.;;;","13/Apr/15 19:01;paulgale;I too have hit the same limitations of the temp store. In the interim you can always force the broker to treat all messages as persistent using the {{forcePersistencyModeBrokerPlugin}}. Alternatively use the broker component. 

Perhaps you might need to supplement it with (it's been a while) this to force the cursor to not use the temp store:

{code}
<pendingQueuePolicy>
  <storeCursor/>
</pendingQueuePolicy>
{code}

Is PFC disabled for your queue? If so, why?

Regardless, even if the temp store worked correctly both memory and disk are limited resources so you're only delaying the inevitable as one of them will eventually fill up - that is, not unless the producer is flow controlled.
;;;","13/Apr/15 19:11;tabish;PFC in this case doesn't matter as the problem occurs outside the normal checks and the add of the message into the cursor stalls while holding the message lock preventing any consumer from ever pulling a message off the Queue so basically the Queue becomes unusable until a broker restart. ;;;","13/Apr/15 19:22;cshannon;As Timothy said, PFC doesn't make a difference and we have tried it both on and off.  For now we have the producer switched to being persistent to fix the issue temporarily. {{forcePersistencyModeBrokerPlugin}} doesn't really help because we want to be able to support both persistent and non-persistent messages on the same destination and don't want to enforce what the producer sets the delivery mode as. ;;;","13/Apr/15 20:46;paulgale;I don't see how this plugin puts a requirement on the producer. For example, setting {{<forcePersistencyModeBrokerPlugin persistenceFlag=""true""/>}} allows the producer to send either form. It simply makes all messages persistent (or non-persistent if {{false}}).
;;;","21/Apr/15 17:12;tabish;Patch with test and a hacked workaround that allows the Queue to stall but still recover via purge or consumption that you can apply to your local broker build for now.  The problem starts to run deep if you track it far enough so we should probably do more work here to clean things up and work more sensibly, and predictably.  ;;;","22/Apr/15 12:45;cshannon;Thanks Timothy.  I have tested out this patch and it looks good.

The reason for the NPE is that in the following excerpt from TempQueue.java, tempDest.getConnectionId() returns null:

{code}
        if (!context.isFaultTolerant()
                && (!context.isNetworkConnection() && !tempDest
                        .getConnectionId().equals(
                                sub.getConsumerInfo().getConsumerId()
                                        .getConnectionId()))) {
{code}

The ActiveMQTempDestination tempDest is created by ActiveMQDestination.createDestination(String, byte):

{noformat}
ActiveMQTempQueue(ActiveMQTempDestination).<init>(String) line: 39	
ActiveMQTempQueue.<init>(String) line: 36

{noformat}

The created object is returned through the call stack as-is until it reaches the onSenderOpen frame, where it is assigned to the ConsumerInfo. The connection ID is never set.

Proposed fix: in DestinationFactoryImpl.createDestination(ConnectionContext, ActiveMQDestination, DestinationStatistics), after casting destination to ActiveMQTempDestination and before instantiating TempQueue, the connection ID (and any other required information) could be set from the ConnectionContext.",,dake,tabish,zgl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Tue Apr 21 21:47:17 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i2cwy7:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"07/Apr/15 16:02;tabish;So the NPE is not great here but what you are trying to do is also not really expected to work.

We are capturing metrics from the advisory messages and this is causing our metrics to be off.;;;","17/Jun/15 15:38;cshannon;[~tabish121],

I noticed this issue the other day and it's a bit odd to me that advisory messages relating to user actions (such as new connection or consumer, etc)  set the {{originBrokerURL}} property with a default URL and not the actual transport URL that was used.  For example, I ran a test and set up a broker with two transports, one nio and one tcp.  I connected using nio but the algorithm picked the tcp transport url to set as the originBrokerURL property when the new connection advisory message was fired.  It would make more sense to me to set the originBrokerUrl property as the nio URL since that was the URL used.  

This would be a pretty easy change as the ConnectionContext has a reference to the Connector used and we could get the publishable connection string from that if the connector has been set. For advisory messages that don't contain the connector (such as internal things like message expiration) a default URL can still be chosen in the same manor as it is now.

Do you have any issue with changing this behavior? The other option is to keep the originBrokerURL behavior as is and add a new property to contain the actual transport url used by the client to connect.  That would prevent issues for existing users which might be relying on the current behavior of how the originBrokerURL property is set.

I've tried recovering the session before I read the first message off the queue (session.recover();) but this has no impact.

If however I read the first message AND THEN recover the session (not acking the just received message), the message is re-delivered and JMSRedelivered=true, redeliveryCounter=1.


I have tried with a transacted Consumer (session = connection.createSession(true, Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED);) this has the same problem, but I can't solve it with session.recover() as it's transacted.

This is a master/slave setup with 3 brokers. I am not restarting the broker between tests, simply killing the Consumer JVM

I couldn't reproduce this using the AmqpNetLite tests after applying all these fixes, can you validate this on your end.

Thanks for the bug report and for your test case.  I took a look at this and there is a race condition.  As you pointed out, the best work around is probably to use concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics=""false"" for now.

In detail, the issue lies in the setLastCacheId method in AbstractStoreCursor which you can see in the stack trace.  In the else clause in that method lastCachedIds[ index].getFutureOrSequenceLong() is returning null because it hasn't been set yet.  KahaDB assigns that value when the message is added to the store in a transaction.   However the TopicStorePefetch cursor is calling trackLastCached before KahaDB actually gets around to finishing the transaction and assigning the value, which happens asynchronously.

[~tabish121] and [~gtully], What do you guys thisnk about this?  It's certainly easy enough to add a null check but then the value is never cached in setLastCachedId as it just skips it.  This may not actually be a problem depending on what the lastCacheId is used for.  If I add a null check in, the test case passes but it seems like there could be a larger concurrency issue here that might need to be resolved besides just adding in a check for a null.
;;;","11/Jun/15 12:06;gtully;[~christopher.l.shannon] - great that you are looking into this, it always helps to have another set of eyes.
I think there are two things to consider: 1) the value of concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics=true - I don't really see the benefit b/c it is very unlikely that all subs will get to ack a message before it is persisted. In the queue case, it does have a beneficial effect b/c it is just a single client that needs to ack fast.
2) what lastCacheId is used for? When the cache is full it stops tracking messages and when the cache is empty, to avoid replaying all messages from the store the cursor wants to start a store replay from the last message that it cached. There is a setBatch that sets the start point. Implicit in this is that the sequenceId in the store is in sync with the order messages are placed in the cursor. That is the crux of it. If the start point is off, there is a potential for a missed dispatch or a duplicate dispatch. Note - I think the durable topic case is a little simpler because of the per sub index, but that would need to be validated.

In the queue case, there are a bunch of hoops that ensure ordering because it is complicated with concurrentStoreAndDispatch. The same attention has not been given to the topic case to date.
If there is a proven usecase for  concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics=true (point 1) - then the is a case for migrating the work done on queue cursors around lastCacheId to topics.
;;;","11/Jun/15 15:13;cshannon;Seeing as how there isn't really a benefit based on your first point and that there is at least one issue documented (as shown by this NPE), should we go ahead and update the documentation here http://activemq.apache.org/kahadb.html to specify that {{concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics}} is not recommended to be enabled?  ;;;","11/Jun/15 15:21;tabish;Agree with that, there doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to enable that for Topics. ;;;","11/Jun/15 15:57;cshannon;I went ahead and updated the documentation with a warning to specify concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics is not recommended.  I would say we should probably close this ticket as there is a larger issue here than just the NPE and there isn't a reason to enable this property right now.  As Gary said, if there is a proven use case then it can be revisited later and a new ticket can be created to migrate the work from the queue case to ensure proper ordering is done.;;;","16/Jun/15 19:02;cshannon;Today I got the exact same null pointer exception in the same spot of the code (setLastCachedId method).  I was just using JMS and not MQTT.  I was doing some testing and I had a producer publishing messages as fast as possible to a topic.  At the time there was an existing offline durable subscription on that topic.  While the producer was running, I removed the durable subscription (using broker.removeSubscription) and the producer received that null pointer exception and closed.  I repeated the test and it didn't happen every time but I can get it to happen every few times.

So it seems like it might be a good idea to at least add in a null pointer check to prevent an exception since there is a race condition issue.;;;","16/Jun/15 20:54;gtully;i wonder if you could try and manufacture a unit test that can reproduce? it does look like some work is needed.;;;","16/Jun/15 21:29;cshannon;I'll try and come up with a test tomorrow that can reproduce it.  It might be hard to get something that happens reliably but I'll see what I can do. ;;;","17/Jun/15 12:03;cshannon;I was actually able to reproduce this reliably in a unit test.  What I discovered with my use case is that the same line is throwing the exception as the test case that was uploaded to this ticket, but it's a slightly different issue.  For the the original issue, astCachedIds[ index].getFutureOrSequenceLong() is returning null which causes the Long.compare method to fail.  In my case, with the durable unsubscribe, candidate.getFutureOrSequenceLong() is returning null and causing the problem.

I'm working on a pull request now to fix both issues and I will push it up shortly.;;;","17/Jun/15 13:25;githubbot;GitHub user cshannon opened a pull request:

We're running a non-persistent broker in production and testing so that's why we found this issue.

It looks like 5.11.0 introduced this issue.

Essentially Advisories fail to fire. 

It looks like it’s a bug with MemoryTransactionStore. Switching to persistent brokers fixes the problem.

It’s because addMessage calls:

        } else {
            destination.addMessage(null, message);
        }

.. with an explicit null.

the message given is:

… and I saw this when I was running mvn test in the main ActiveMQ test suite (or at least pretty sure I did) so this is happening not just in my code. 

The full exception , which I captured by setting a break point is below.

... the core issue here looks like the message doesn't have a TransactionId and MemoryTransactionStore has an addMessages which has a fall through of addMessage with a null context which then causes the NPE.

Did messages have an implicit transaction Id before?

    AMQ-5645 - Updated DayOfMonth cron to roll to next month properly.

    For the Minutes and Hours tokens in CronParser.buildCronEntries() the CronEntry.end value was correctly +1 of actually allowed end values (ex. a time of 10:60 is not possible).  Updated DayOfMonth to also be +1 (32 instead of 31).  Expanded unit tests included.

Notice how the ""else""-block will kick in on null value, whereby we get the ""value.getClass()"" executed when inside the constructor argument creation of the wrongly thrown MessageFormatException, resulting in NPE.

Instead, a code block like every other getter has should be employed, here from getString right above:

High CPU load when using failover transport in network connector,AMQ-5605,12776495,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

They are deployed on three servers, with one ActiveMQ instance from each master/slave setup on every server. They are using the leveldb and zookeeper. Everything works fine.

Now I've got the strange behaviour that when I add a network connector to each ActiveMQ instance like this:
{code}
networkConnector name=""toMasterSlave02"" dynamicOnly=""true"" uri=""masterslave:(tcp://host1:61617,tcp://host2:61617,tcp://host3:61617)""
{code}

When you now restart the master of the master/slave setup that is targeted by the above network connector the cpu load on the current master goes and stays up at 100%, i.e. it uses one CPU per configured transportConnector.

Now the explanation, mostly copied from http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/High-CPU-load-with-network-connector-failover-transport-tp4691798.html
{quote}
When one of the brokers is restarted, the other broker uses ~400% CPU. The cause is the FailoverTransport reconnectTask spinning, and nothing is stopping the task.

Reverting this fix made for AMQ-5315, while it does reintroduce the NullPointerException, does handle failover properly without spinning:
https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/repo?p=activemq.git;a=commitdiff;h=c391321d1b5b59542d847717654b0d4dba54cf2f <https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/repo?p=activemq.git;a=commitdiff;h=c391321d1b5b59542d847717654b0d4dba54cf2f>

The reason it works after reverting that change is the NullPointerException is caught, -> serviceLocalException() -> ServiceSupport.dispose(getControllingService()); with the fix made in AMQ-5315, the dispose() call is never made.

Sorry, but I've got no clue how to provide a unit test for this. Maybe someone else can help.

Otherwise you end up with the NPE error getting fired out which causes confusion in the logs.  Thoughts?

We investigated this and have seen that this is caused by a race condition.
When the BrokerService is configured to be async, the starting of the broker will hang when the starting of the PersistenceAdapter is faster than expected.

The ActiveMQ code will first start the persistence adapter, and then start the broker. When startup is configured to be 'async', these actions will happen async (in separate threads). Since these calls are async, we can not garuantee the order in which they will be finished. Although the ActiveMQ code now relies on the fact that the starting of the persistence adapter takes longer, and it waits in the starting of the broker for the starting of the persistence adapter to finish. When the starting of the persistence adapter already finished before the starting of the broker starts waiting for it, it will wait forever (and thus the broker cannot get started).

In the following snippet from org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerService this becomes clear:

'startPersistenceAdapter' is fast and already notifies: persistenceAdapterLock.notifyAll();. 
'startBroker' will wait for notification but no one will ever notify it again: persistenceAdapterLock.wait();

I am new around here, so sorry if I get the etiquette wrong...

I am working on a project to use Apache ActiveMQ with a RESTful interface.  It's a cross platform error logging project, so code written in C++, Java, VBA, Perl or indeed anything that can access an URL can then report issues. The point is, we DO NOT deploy any libraries - we simply use the native implementations within the language to access an URL.  The HTTP message body then contains the details of the error - who, what, when, what line of code and so on.

The piece I am working on is a port of an MSMQ implementation (you can a simpllified implementation of the MSMQ version on this http://blog.alignment-systems.com/2015/03/excel-vba-industrialisationpart-seven.html and on github at https://github.com/JohnGreenan/7_ExcelVBE)

So, I can access Apache Active MQ from a Windows PC using the WinHttp.WinHttpRequest class (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384106%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

The issue is that when I try and send a body of the request, I get the same error as shown in this JIRA.

Within cURL it's possible to workaround as described by Mark Frazier, but I have tried a few approaches on this WITHIN VBA and failed to get it to work.

What I propose to do is to create a github repository with the VBA code and instructions on how to replicate, but I am not sure if that's how you guys work? Do you actually work with implementations in languages, or is it just the case that it it works with cURL then the other language implementation is viewed as being at fault?

Can you please give me some guidance on how I can work with you to get this resolved?

Cheers,

John;;;","01/Apr/15 02:05;John Greenan;Replication code and instructions as well as log files from Apache ActiveMQ all on github now at

Deleting lock file on broker shut down can take a master broker down,AMQ-5568,12772996,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

I can reproduce reliably on a NFSv4 mount using a persistence adapter configuration like 

{code}
<levelDB directory=""/nfs/activemq/data/leveldb"" lockKeepAlivePeriod=""5000"">
  <locker>
    <shared-file-locker lockAcquireSleepInterval=""10000""/>
  </locker>
</levelDB>
{code}

However the problem is also reproducible using kahaDB.
Two broker instances competing for the lock on the shared storage (e.g. leveldb or kahadb). Lets say brokerA becomes master, broker B slave.

If brokerA looses access to the NFS share, it will shut down. As part of shutting down, it tries delete the lock file of the persistence adapter. Now since the NFS share is gone, all file i/o calls hang for a good while before returning errors. As such the broker shut down gets delayed.

In the meantime the slave broker B (not affected by the NFS problem) grabs the lock and becomes master.

If the NFS mount is restored while broker A (the previous master) still hangs on the file i/o operations (as part of its shutdown routine), the attempt to delete the persistence adapter lock file will finally succeed and broker A shuts down. 

Deleting the lock file however also affects the new master broker B who periodically runs a keepAlive() check on the lock. That check verifies the file still exists and the FileLock is still valid. As the lock file got deleted, keepAlive() fails on broker B and that broker shuts down as well. 
The overall result is that both broker instances have shut down despite an initially successful failover.

Using restartAllowed=true is not an option either as this can cause other problems in an NFS based master/slave setup.

    Refactor the way sessions are pooled.  We don't need to keep the
    PooledSession instances around since the state is unique to the session
    it wraps we only need to keep the Session instances in the SessionPool
    and create a new PooledSession on borrow to manage that session.  This
    allows the PooledSession to have a real closed state that protects
    against multiple close calls placing duplicate PooledSession instances
    into the SessionPool.  This also simplifies the code in the
    XaConnectionPool since it doesn't need to try and reset state in
    PouledSessions before placing them back as it gets a fresh wrapper each

It sounds like the right result here is the anonymous producer should get closed if it was created with session.createProducer(...)- unless there is a way to create the anonymous producer specifically as a cached producer.  The reasoning is this -- closing an ordinary (i.e. non-pooled) connection removes producers and consumers created for all sessions in that connection.

Both brokers are started and the master broker acquires file lock on the lock file and the slave broker sits in a loop and waits for a lock as expected. Also changing brokers work as expected.

Once the network connection of the NFS server is disconnected both master and slave NFS mounts block and slave broker stops logging file lock re-tries. After a short while after bringing the network connection back the mounts come back and the slave broker is able to acquire the lock simultaneously. Both brokers accept client connections.

In this situation it is also possible to stop and start both individual brokers many times and they are always able to acquire the lock even if the other one is already running. Only after stopping both brokers and starting them again is the situation back to normal.

In this case the master broker is able to renew the lock and continue operating and the slave broker fails to get the lock.

However if the network outage is significantly longer (tested with various durations between 30 and 300 seconds), both brokers are able to get lock on the file and start working simutaneously. Even though the master brokers dmesg shows the following message after the outage:

""NFS: nfs4_reclaim_open_state: Lock reclaim failed!""

It seems that this happens if the lock reclaiming (keepAlive?) operation on the master broker gets blocked for long enough time for the NFS server lease timeout to pass. In this case the slave is able to claim the lock (if it's NFS filesystem stops blocking earlier) and after the master stops blocking it continues to operate even though NFS client reports ""Lock reclaim failed!"".

In later testing, different configurations were tested and finally the settings were:

    <shared-file-locker lockAcquireSleepInterval=""15000""/>

{code}

as mentioned in the last comment. This setup combined with NFSv4 lease timeout of 60 seconds yielded the best results although still failing when the network outage was long enough for the NFS filesystem to block for a long time (even after the connection was restored).

Mount options are there in the issue description but I re-visited them for further testing and finally used these (trying to increase the timeout value to maximum):

rw,nfsvers=4,proto=tcp,timeo=6000,retrans=3,hard,wsize=65536,rsize=65536

Although this didn't make much difference compared to the default timeout of 600 deciseconds.

I will give restartAllowed a try.

Furthermore I tested the exact same setup with a NetApp filer NFSv4 server with the exact same settings and brokers behaved as they should have. Master was able to continue operating and slave did not get the lock after 5, 30, 45 or 180 second outages.
;;;","30/Jan/15 08:27;tmielke;Some of the NFS mount options may not support a quick broker failover from master to slave. 
The options we finally got best results with where

{code}
timeo=100,retrans=1,soft,noac
{code}

We reduced the timeout to 10 seconds and also reduced the retry to just 1. 
In addition a hard mount seems to retry NFS operations forever (according to man page) and using soft operations will fail after retrans transmission attempts. Most likely what you want to ensure a quick failover.
And finally the noac option seemed to had a big effect as well on the speed at which the master broker detects the NFS failure as it also caused a sync write to NFS, which seems to propagate exceptions more quickly. It most likely has a negative impact on performance though.

I can't provide a scientific support for these arguments other than above but with these settings the master broker would should down much quicker upon an NFS failure. 
;;;","30/Jan/15 09:34;heikki_m;I'm a bit hesitant on using soft mounts unless ActiveMQ explicitly requires them. NetApp and others always advice against using soft mounts with NFSv4. Problem we're having is not with the broker failover but with what happens if the shared storage fails (both brokers lose the connection) and how the brokers recover from it after the NFSv4 lock lease has expired.

Have you tested your setup with failing the NFS server connection or killing the server ungracefully? For me soft mounts only made the situation worse (which kind of makes sense).

Here's some other issues around the subject (for those with RHN access):

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1195703
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/478053
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/382283

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ENTMQ-391;;;","30/Jan/15 13:07;tmielke;I am not suggesting ActiveMQ requires a soft NFS mount. Just noticed we got NFS errors propagated much quicker using soft mounts. 

Yes, the fix for ENTMQ-391 will be needed and its contained in 5.9.0. See AMQ-4705.

In my tests I shut down the nic of the nfs client machine that runs the broker and tested how quickly this resulted in an error on the master broker and how quickly a slave broker running on a different machine takes over. 

With the NFS options 

{code}
timeo=50,retrans=1,soft,noac
{code}

and the previously suggested broker configuration the master broker would raise an exception within 15 secs after loosing access to the NFS share and would shutdown within another 1-2 minutes. During the shutdown the broker tries to close all file pointing to the persistence store and that close() call hangs too and needs to timeout as well.
It took about 60 - 80 seconds for the slave broker to take over. 

Previously testing with default NFS mount options the master broker would some times not shut down within 10+ minutes. 

I took various thread dumps along the way and the broker was always hung in a Java I/O operation that took a long time to finally raise an exception. 
Was able to reproduce the same behavior using a very simple Java application that only tries the same Java I/O. So IMHO the entire issue is really down to configuring NFS in a way that it quickly raises errors to the application stack.
 
;;;","30/Jan/15 13:19;heikki_m;Yes that is the case when you break the connection between one of the brokers and the NFS storage. What I'm after and testing is the situation when you break the connection to the NFS storage altogether so that _both_ brokers lose the connectivity simultaneously and what happens _after_ the connection to the NFS share comes back. This is when both brokers are able to grab the lock.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough in the original issue description but this is about NFS server failures (crash, network outage, ungraceful shutdown, ...) affecting all the NFS clients.;;;","30/Jan/15 15:06;sburkard;Hi 

The two cases are different, but I'm not sure if this makes a difference. 

When, for whatever reason, the shared storage lock is released by the shared storage provider (after the grace period), the slave can grab the lock, becomes master and works as expected. This works fine in all cases I have seen.

The key question is how the former master behaves. In all descriptions about two active master brokers, the problem arises because the former master continues to do so. So the real problem is that the master does not recognize that he has lost the lock. This can happen in all shared storage configurations. 

Jean-Baptiste Onofré describes the same problem with a shared JDBC datastore here: http://blog.nanthrax.net/2013/10/apache-activemq-5-7-5-9-and-master-slave. 

In my tests with shared LevelDB-Store over NFS4 and hard mounts, the former master broker NEVER realized that another broker has taken the lock. With a soft mount it was realizing the new situation after a massive delay (about 5 minutes). With the NFS options Torsten mentioned the master broker realizes the new situation after 15 to 30 seconds. I am not saying that these settings are save for production, I just observed that changes to NFS settings lead to completely different results. 

So my guess is that the whole problem is just a matter of NFS settings. But this part is never mentioned in example setups etc. Is anybody out there who has a working and tested shared-filesystem architecture with NFS? It would be very helpful to have a ""reference configuration"" that works. ;;;","30/Jan/15 15:16;tmielke;{quote}
Maybe I wasn't clear enough in the original issue description but this is about NFS server failures (crash, network outage, ungraceful shutdown, ...) affecting all the NFS clients.

Got you. Have not tested that. With restartAllowed=false the master should shut down at the least and stop its transport connectors.

Also did some more reading on sync mount option. It is discouraged in some posts but I would hope that by also using noac or sync mount option, it should be okay as writes are sync now. So data should not get corrupted. This however comes at the expense of a performance degradation.


;;;","31/Jan/15 06:31;artnaseef;One thing to make clear here (it seemed unclear from the title and original bug description).  There's a choice that must be made here - either allow for the possibility of neither broker being active (NFS v3 approach) or allow for the possibility of both being active (NFS v4) -- for some period of time.

It will be possible to reduce the amount of time the two brokers in an H/A pair are simultaneously active through NFS options - if the broker can detect the condition.  But it's not possible to eliminate the possibility of both being active for some time with NFS v4.

With that said, if the original active broker does not stop once it realizes that it lost the lock, or it cannot reliably detect a lost lock, a fix is welcome.  Just be aware that even with such a fix, there's a possibility of corruption to the KahaDB.  Documentation of various NFS settings and their outcomes would also be welcome.;;;","06/Feb/15 13:32;tmielke;Also see AMQ-5568.;;;","03/Jul/15 11:47;gtully;The window if closed via https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=9bc602be

The commit dd68c61e65f24b7dc498b36e34960a4bc46ded4b by Gary from 8.10.2010 introduced a problem by deleting too many files.

Scenarios we are facing currently in production:
Data file #1 contains unconsumed messages sitting in a DLQ. So this file is not a cleanup candidate.
The next file #2 contains acks of some messages from file #1. This file is not a cleanup candidate (because of ackMessageFileMap logic).
The next file #3 contains acks of some messages from file #2. And this file is deleted during the cleanup procedure. So on Broker restart all messages from #2, whose acks were from the deleted file #3, are replayed!
The reason is gcCandidates variable, which is a copy of gcCandidateSet (see MessageDatabase#checkpointUpdate at the end of the method - org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/MessageDatabase.java:1659 on 5.10.0 tag). So when a candidate is deleted from gcCandidateSet (org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/MessageDatabase.java:1668 on 5.10.0 tag), gcCandidates still contains that candidate and the comparison on org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/MessageDatabase.java:1666 works wrong!

;;;","27/Jan/15 22:39;barlabanov;This is the possible patch.
Just removed the copy of gcCandidateSet. It is unclear to me what was the purpose of this copy.;;;","27/Jan/15 22:42;barlabanov;The consequence of the fix is that if you are really unlucky you will get all files blocked beginning from the one with unconsumed message/messages through all next files containing acks pointing to the files before them.
So having some unconsumed messages for a long term (like messages in a DLQ) in such an unlucky case will eat quite a lot of space.;;;","27/Jan/15 22:48;barlabanov;AMQ-2736 actually introduced the problem. See the comment of Gary https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2736#comment-12942986.
It was thought to be a logical error, but it was not. It is not possible just to drop the files, when they contain acks pointing to other files, which are blocked.;;;","28/Jan/15 00:18;barlabanov;Tim, I think, you are right. Otherwise KahaDB will loose acks and replay messages.
If this is true, than the current cleanup mechanism have to be reconsidered. It will not work well for scenarios, where messages may stay unconsumed for some time. Some sort of compaction has to be done.
In the current project we have nearly always some messages in DLQs sitting there for maximum 2 days. This means that we would always have nearly all data files for the last two days.
Currently it is ok, we have enough of place on the SAN. But what if that would be 2 weeks instead of 2 days?
I think in this case we would use JDBC storage.
Another possibility would be to use mKahaDB and put DLQs to a separate storage. That storage would not grow fast since there would not be much traffic.;;;","28/Jan/15 15:45;gtully;mKahaDB is the current answer to the need for compaction/rewrite problem. that is why it emerged. Partition based on the average length of time a message spends in a queue.;;;","28/Jan/15 17:04;artnaseef;To Tim's point -- if there is *any* content in the data file that means it is needed, then the file must not be removed.  That problem exists even for messages - one, small message can hold an entire data file.

Therefore, if there is an acknowledgement in the data file that still needs to be processed, the data file must not be removed.

As Gary mentioned, multi-kahadb can be used to better prevent the scenario of large holes in data files.

Keep in mind - it's in the JMS specification that consumers are expected to be ""timely"" (I forget the exact wording).  ActiveMQ (and other JMS solutions) are not ""message stores"" - using them as such leads to many issues.  If messages need to be stored for a length of time, I generally recommend adding a store to the architecture and moving those messages out of ActiveMQ and into the store as-needed.

With that said, a solution to the compaction problem would be quite welcome.;;;","28/Jan/15 17:34;tbain98;Consumers can be timely but unsuccessful, leading to messages going to the DLQ, where they can cause exactly this kind of behavior.  So as ActiveMQ is currently implemented the expectation Art referenced (that consumers be timely) needs to be applied to the DLQ as well, which isn't how I'd expect to need to interact with a DLQ.  I would assume that I could come in the next morning, see that there were messages in the DLQ that failed for some reason, and decide what to do about them.  But even if we simply fix this bug by not deleting the KahaDB files that are still needed (potentially all of them), then the consequence of that is going to be potentially large KahaDB disk usage for just a few messages, which I think most developers/admins won't be expecting.

The way I just described interacting with the DLQ does in fact use it as a message store, and I think that's a valid use case.

I think that fixing this specific bug is better than not (high disk usage is better than invalid message redelivery, IMO), but I think another solution (which could be mKahaDB, or something else such as having a separate KahaDB for the DLQ) is still needed (in a separate JIRA enhancement).  I submitted AMQ-5547 to capture that need.;;;","29/Jan/15 00:52;barlabanov;This is correct. This is what we have in production. We have some messages in DLQs. They stay there for max 2 days. After that a special job removes messages older than 2 days from the DLQs.
Now we expect that ActiveMQ will always retain nearly all data files for the last two days because of those messages in the DLQs. So this would take quite a lot of space I think and we did not expect that when we set up the servers - may be we will have to get a larger SAN volume for that.

Another consideration is that this is not only the space which will be eaten by KahaDB but also the time ActiveMQ needs to recover after the crash. ActiveMQ will need quite a lot of time to replay all the data files which are sitting there just because of several DLQ messages.
And the periodic cleanup may take more time to check all the data files (and KahaDB cleanup is a single threaded storage blocking operation).;;;","29/Jan/15 02:28;tbain98;One option to work around this problem might be to have a job that periodically consumes all DLQ messages and re-sends them to the DLQ as a new message.  That way the dead messages are always near the newest messages in KahaDB and it can delete the old files.  You'll lose metadata about when the original message was sent/received/etc., but that may be better than what you have now.  (And you could always wrap the original message, with all its metadata, in a wrapper message if you wanted to keep that info.)  This should still get fixed and the improvement I submitted should still get implemented, but that workaround might get you by until the improvement gets implemented.;;;","29/Jan/15 03:31;artnaseef;DLQs are a common cause of this problem.  My recommendation when using DLQs is *always* have a plan for handling them and consume them in a timely manner.

Again, if the messages need to be stored for a period of time (like 2 days), the best approach is to get them out of ActiveMQ and put them in some type of message store.  Another consideration of this use-case: keeping the messages for this period means some manual action is expected.  ActiveMQ is not designed to give ""random access"" to messages, which would typically be needed for manual intervention, but instead to produce and consume as a queue.  This use-case would be better served with a database in which individual messages could be referenced.

Regardless, this is how ActiveMQ currently functions.  Until something better is implemented, these data files must not be deleted until they are no longer used.;;;","29/Jan/15 09:49;gtully;i will review and try and recall the need for the copy. great find. patch with test case is always much appreciated :-);;;","02/Feb/15 13:07;gtully;test and fix applied (reverted the change from AMQ-2736) with thanks. all tests look good.

If no network interface is explicitly set, it calls mcast.joinGroup(inetAddress); without setting one on the MulticastSocket.  In that case, MulticastSocket then calls NetworkInterface.getDefault().    The ""default"" interface on a system is relatively unpredictable and COULD result in a network interface that isn't even multicast enabled.     On my mac, it's selecting a ""awdl0"" interface which doesn't support multicast.   If I have Parallels running, it sometimes picks up one of those interfaces.   It also sometimes picks up an ipv6 only network interface which also doesn't support the ipv4 broadcast address.

It would be better to enumerate the network interfaces and at least make sure we grab one that support multicast on ipv4 and is ""up"".

If I restart the broker, the ActiveMQ layer tries 5 reconnect attempts then gives up and the listener throws up connection refused exception and then tries to refresh the jms connection and says its refreshed but there is not connection made to ActiveMQ and the listener again throws up connection refused exception and again refreshes the jms connection but fails. This process continues indefinitely.

However, I use single listener and no sharing of connection, this works fine. The ActiveMQ layers tries 5 reconnect attempts fails, listener throws up exception and again triggers reconnect attempts which does not happens in case of multiple listener.


This issue doesn't happen with ActiveMQ 5.8.0


Steps to reproduce this issue:

<bean id=""connectionFactory"" class=""org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory"">
        <property name=""brokerURL"" value=""failover:(tcp://<hostname1>:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=120000,tcp://<hostname2>:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=120000)?randomize=false&amp;maxReconnectAttempts=5"" />
    </bean>

<bean id=""jmsConnectionFactory""
        class=""org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory""
        destroy-method=""stop"">
        <property name=""connectionFactory"" ref=""connectionFactory"" />
    </bean>

    <amq:topic id=""testTopic"" physicalName=""test.topic""/>

    <!-- The message listener container to invoke the consumer -->
    <bean id=""jmsContainer1""
        class=""org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer""
        p:connectionFactory-ref=""jmsConnectionFactory""
        p:destination-ref=""testTopic""
        p:pubSubDomain=""true""
        p:subscriptionDurable=""false""
        p:sessionTransacted=""true""
        p:messageListener-ref=""consumer"" />

    <bean id=""jmsContainer2""
        class=""org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer""
        p:connectionFactory-ref=""jmsConnectionFactory""
        p:destination-ref=""testTopic""
        p:pubSubDomain=""true""
        p:subscriptionDurable=""false""
        p:sessionTransacted=""true""
        p:messageListener-ref=""consumer"" />

Use this configuration and start the application.
Now restart the ActiveMQ broker once the listeners successfully connect.

Here are some logs:

2014-12-10 16:21:58,842 | INFO  | KahaDB: Recovering checkpoint thread after death | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-26

This means that the checkpoint thread is being revived unnecessarily while
stopping the broker. It could even happen that it is revived multiple times before the closing process is completed.

To show the flow of the race condition, consider the following blocks of code from activemq/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/MessageDatabase.java:

Lines 425 - 442 [in close()]

if( opened.compareAndSet(true, false)) {
     ... some code ...
          if (metadata.page != null) {
               checkpointUpdate(true);
          }
     ... some code ...
}

Lines 1499 - 1501 [in checkpointUpdate(boolean)]

public void execute(Transaction tx) throws IOException {
     checkpointUpdate(tx, cleanup);
}

Line 1524 [in checkpointUpdate(Transaction, boolean)]

metadata.ackMessageFileMapLocation = checkpointAckMessageFileMap();

Line 1735 [in checkpointAckMessageFileMap()]

Location location = store(new KahaAckMessageFileMapCommand().setAckMessageFileMap(new Buffer(baos.toByteArray())), nullCompletionCallback);

Lines 993 - 995 [in store(...)]

if (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive()) {
     startCheckpoint();
}

Lines 332  - 372  [In startCheckpoint()]
if (checkpointThread == null) {
     start = true;
} else if (!checkpointThread.isAlive()) {
     start = true;
      LOG.info(""KahaDB: Recovering checkpoint thread after death"");
}

if (start) {
     checkpointThread = new Thread(""ActiveMQ Journal Checkpoint Worker"") {
          @Override
          public void run() {
               try {
                     ... some code ...
                     while (opened.get()) {
                          ... some code ...
                     }
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                            // Looks like someone really wants us to exit this thread...
                } catch (IOException ioe) {
                            LOG.error(""Checkpoint failed"", ioe);
                            brokerService.handleIOException(ioe);
               }
          }
     };

     checkpointThread.setDaemon(true);
     checkpointThread.start();
}

Here is the sequence of events, involving code above that shows the race:

1. in close() set ""opened"" to false
2. in startCheckpoint() ""opened.get()"" is false so checkpoint thread exits run method and makes checkpointThread.isAlive() false
3. in store(...) calling startCheckpoint() which will revive the checkpoint thread again

Added some INFO logs to confirm the order above:

2014-12-17 13:27:43,678 | INFO  | patanasov: from unload() calling close() | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18

2014-12-17 13:27:43,682 | INFO  | KahaDB: Recovering checkpoint thread after death | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18

Based on my limited understanding of this code, this does not seem to have any serious negative impacts, but it would be nice to be looked at by the community.   

It does not seem to make sense to revive the thread after opened.get() became false because the checkpointThread will not do anything anyway due to opened.get() being false at that point. Consider the body of the checkpointThread:

MessageDatabase.java, Lines 348 - 359

while (opened.get()){
     ... code that will attempt updates ...
}

However, since opened.get() is false, this will not enter the while loop and hence the checkpointThread will exit its run quickly again.

A possible fix for this is the following

Lines 993 - 995 [in store(...)]

change

if (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive()) {
     startCheckpoint();
}

to

if (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive() && opened.get()) {
     startCheckpoint();
}

If opened.get() is false, then we must be closing and we will not revive the thread.

Currently, such TransportConnection IOException(s) are handled and logged on the WARN level when actually they are harmless as the broker is shutting down. For one such example, please consider the following code blocks from  activemq-5.10.0:

activemq\activemq-broker\src\main\java\org\apache\activemq\broker\TransportConnection.java

Lines 933 - 937

try {
     broker.preProcessDispatch(messageDispatch);
} catch (RuntimeException convertToIO) {
     throw new IOException(convertToIO);
}

When this block throws the IOException, it is caught and further thrown from 

Lines 941 - 951

} catch (IOException e) {
     if (messageDispatch != null) {
          TransmitCallback sub = messageDispatch.getTransmitCallback();
           broker.postProcessDispatch(messageDispatch);
           if (sub != null) {
                sub.onFailure();
           }
           messageDispatch = null;
           throw e;
     }
}

When this block throws the exception, it is further caught and serviced by

Lines 989 - 995

} catch (IOException e) {
     if (dispatchStopped.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
          dispatchStoppedLatch.countDown();
     }
     serviceExceptionAsync(e);
     return false;
}

Lines 267 - 276 (serviceExceptionAsync) create a new ""Async Exception Handler"" thread which will invoke serviceException

Lines 287 - 289

if (e instanceof IOException) {
     serviceTransportException((IOException) e);
}

This will evaluate to true and hence serviceTransportException is invoked

Lines 242 - 246

if (TRANSPORTLOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
     TRANSPORTLOG.debug(this + "" failed: "" + e, e);
} else if (TRANSPORTLOG.isWarnEnabled() && !expected(e)) {
     TRANSPORTLOG.warn(this + "" failed: "" + e);
}

If debug is enabled, then it is OK for all IOExceptions to be logged. However, in the ""else if"" case, it is not considered if this TransportConnection IOException is being handled while the broker is shutting down. The suggestion is to consider the value of this.broker.getBrokerService().isStopping() as part of the expected(e) call to limit the amount of benign WARN messages that can show up in the log and cause confusion as the broker is shutting down.

A patch for this fix will be provided.

During the run there're about 12000 msg flow in per second, not a very high rate, but ActiveMQ consumes a lot of CPU resource (about 600%~1000%). To find out what's the most CPU consuming code path, I use JProfiler to dig into the process. 

Among all the NIO worker threads, most of them were frequently blocked and did a little job between the 'unblocked' time. While they're expected spend most of their time slices on waiting for work item and processed them.

!nio_worker_blocked_frequently.png!

After reviewing the monitor usage history and stats, I think these NIO workers were competing fiercely with each other on executing a synchronized method (DestinationMap::get), which is also the most hot spot in the program . I also notice that the caller AbstractRegion::getDestinations acquires a read lock before calling it, so I guess this could be a left out, read lock is the actual lock type required here.

!monitor_usage_stats.png!

!nio_worker_blocked_1.png!

http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html

When I first tried to post a simple message to a queue (and this queue didn't exist yet) I used this script:

{noformat}
$ curl -d ""body=message"" -XPOST http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message/queue/orders/input
{noformat}

The above is mostly based on the documentation.  I was surprised to find no queue created by looking at the web console, but i _*did*_ see a Topic created called 'queue.orders.input' and it contained 1 message (odd because there's no consumers defined).

After deleting the topic I then tried the 'other format' of the URL:

{noformat}
 curl -d ""body=message"" -XPOST http://admin:admin@localhost:8161/api/message/orders.input?type=queue
{noformat}

This does create a Queue of name 'orders.input' as one would expect.

I'm not exactly clear then from the documentation where in the URL one is defining it as a queue using the former syntax.  The URL in the documentation sort of _implies_ that the 'queue' prefix of the URL is creating a queue named 'orders.input' but it doesn't turn out that way.

So either this is a bug, or the documentation needs tweaking.

I have been configured max connections on a transport connector and real number of clients  (wireless devices) is 2000, but connections count when invoke operator in JMX and losf (command linux) more than 65000 TCP opened.

The fact that, at a time only one a socket is opened. But connection not release when client disconnect not properly, client MQTT is removed on broker, but TCP socket don't. 
You can use telnet client to double check:
Example: Please try three simple steps:
1/ telnet <broker ip>:port
2/ view on Jconsole for JMX connector: image bellow
Socket tcp appear in folder remoteAddress

!http://s3.postimg.org/xbplh535f/amq.png!

3/ Close telnet client, waiting a long time (could be 1 hour, 1 day,...), socket tcp not release, so a humman could be attack by open many sockets :(

In real-production, my clients could be disconnect not properly and many tcp not release and cause max-openfiles error.

Sorry my English!;;;","08/Dec/14 23:01;tabish;You can add the keepAlive option to your transport connector and configure the OS to check on a more regular interval than the default two hour value.  When you close the telnet session you leave a half open socket and the broker needs the TCP stack to signal that it has gone so keepAlive would be a good solution.  ;;;","05/Jan/15 22:26;tabish;Given that many MQTT clients will run on potentially unreliable connections it's probably not a bad idea to add in connection negotiation timeout detection simillar to that of the OpenWire transport.  Unlike STOMP MQTT is binary and would not be usable in telnet which is why the STOMP transport doesn't implement this.  ;;;","05/Jan/15 23:55;tabish;Fixed on trunk, you can use the 'transport.connectAttemptTimeout' option to configure how long before the opened connection is kept around without receiving a CONNECT frame from the client.

If the messages aren't added to the AMQP transaction in sequence, e.g. the assumed 'last id' is actually for a message dispatched before the assumed 'first id' in the sequence, the check fails even though all the messages being acked are in the dispatched list. There is also an implicit assumption in the processing that the ack range is an unbroken sequence, and as a result it would seem possible for messages to be acked that were not actually considered part of the AMQP transaction. This non-sequential ordering can for example happen because a client isn't releasing unconsumed prefetched messages after a rollback of consumed messages, or alternatively is processing higher priority messages before lower priority messages originally dispatched to it earlier. 

To combat these issues, the AMQP transaction commit processing should be updated to use 'individual acks'.",,robbie,tabish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"01/Dec/14 18:40;robbie;0001-AMQ-5467-update-AMQP-commit-processing-to-use-indivi.patch;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12684453/0001-AMQ-5467-update-AMQP-commit-processing-to-use-indivi.patch",,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Mon Dec 01 19:16:55 UTC 2014,,,,,,,Patch Available,,,,"0|i22xm7:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"01/Dec/14 18:40;robbie;Attaching patch to resolve issue.

Because the 2 thread's Thread factory is object of JDBCPersistenceAdapter's inner class, so the object of JDBCPersistenceAdapter can be reached from the 2 threads, JDBCPersistenceAdapter has a field point to BrokerService. So the instance of BrokerService can be reached from the 2 threads.

So the stopped brokerService cannot be GC.

The root cause is that when stopping JDBCPersistenceAdapter, only cancelling cleanupTicket without shutdown clockDaemon, that's why the 2 threads are still alive.

According to http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-restart-embedded-broker.html, it's better (more reliable) to instantiate the broker again instead of reuse old broker. So if I restart embeded broker, there will be  1 more BrokerService in memory.

Based on what I was seeing on Windows, I attached a patch to JIRA 5422:

I didn't test on Linux but that patch should help for windows.

Basically the variable needs quotes around it in the script.

The ActiveMQ client does not do this by default and makes doing so somewhat difficult.

The result is that most applications that use the ActiveMQ client with SSL are not getting the security they think they are.  For a very good explanation of this hostname verification issue, see http://tersesystems.com/2014/03/23/fixing-hostname-verification/

It is worth nothing that ActiveMQ was specifically mentioned in a paper titled ""The Most Dangerous Code in the World:  Validating SSL Certificates in Non-Browser Software"" (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf):

""Java-based Web-services middleware, such as Apache Axis, Axis 2, and Codehaus XFire, is broken, too. So is the Android library for Pusher notification API and Apache ActiveMQ implementation of Java Message Service. All programs employing this middleware are generically insecure.""

Also, ActiveMQ is specifically mentioned in CVE-2012-5784 (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5784) as an example of a library that does not do host name checking.  I can't explain why this hasn't been a bigger deal (am I missing something?).

We have worked around this in our code by providing our own connection factory class that inherits from ActiveMQSslConnectionFactory.  It overrides the createTrustManager() and setKeyAndTrustManagers(...) methods in order to ""decorate"" the real TrustManagers with a check for certificate host name.  Currently, it uses org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER from the Apache HTTP Client project to verify the host name, which works for our project because we already use the Apache HTTP Client elsewhere.

I created this issue with a Major priority, although it could be argued that it's Critical because it's security related and likely to affect so many people.

The issue is that getDesitinations() returns all durable subscriptions.  We have an environment which has status / state which are retained, as well, each client supports 10 durable subscriptions.  With 10 K client connections this implies a dip into the DB which will return 80 bytes for each DESTINATION in the data base * 10K or 8 Meg on each connect.   This needs to be filtered in the DB query since you are not looking for other clientids.  All PersistenceAdaptors implemented have this issue. 

I have modified the all the DB adaptors to support a new method called getDestinations(String client_id).  I have also modified the JDBC query to support a query which is specific to a given client-id and does not need to loop through all (thousands of ) connections filtering the client_id in the code..

However, when run against ActiveMQ 5.10 or 5.11 SNAPSHOT one self tests causes a batch of messages to get stuck in the broker.
The self test in question is [LinkTests.cs CloseBusyReceiver|https://amqpnetlite.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#test/Test.Amqp.NetMF/LinkTests.cs].

The test 
* opens a sender and receiver to node q1.
* sends 20 messages. 
* when the receiver receives the first message it closes the receiver and that causes an AMQP detach. 
* then the test opens a second receiver and tries to drain the 20 messages.
The test fails because the second receiver never receives anything. The AMQ web console shows the 20 messages in the queue. 

Running the test again without clearing the queue results in 40 messages in the queue and the self test fails because the first receiver never receives any messages and thus never closes the busy receiver. The first 20 messages jam that queue.

Also, the messages are not received by tools that normally work fine, like qpid-receive.

This effect is 100% repeatable.

The test code command lines are:
{noformat}
qpid-send -a ""chuck; {create:always}"" --connection-options {protocol:amqp1.0} --sequence yes --content-string 0
qpid-receive -a chuck -m 1 --connection-options ""{protocol:amqp1.0}"" --print-headers yes
{noformat}

When I run the tests against qpidd they send one message and receive one message every time. However against ActiveMQ 5.11 the qpid-receive does not receive the message until one of several conditions:
* the qpid-receive command also includes ""--timeout 1""
* the qpid-receive command is repeated several, possibly dozens, of times.

When qpidd broker is running or when activemq is running and --timeout is specified then the qpid-receive output is:
{noformat}
chug@FJELD ~> qpid-receive -a chuck -m 1 --connection-options ""{protocol:amqp1.0}"" --print-headers yes
Properties: {sn:1, ts:1414177685195174548, x-amqp-first-acquirer:True}

0
{noformat}

However, activemq running the client twice without the timeout and once with the timeout looks like this:
{noformat}
chug@FJELD ~> qpid-receive -a chuck -m 1 --connection-options ""{protocol:amqp1.0}"" --print-headers yes
chug@FJELD ~> qpid-receive -a chuck -m 1 --connection-options ""{protocol:amqp1.0}"" --print-headers yes
chug@FJELD ~> qpid-receive -a chuck -m 1 --connection-options ""{protocol:amqp1.0}"" --print-headers yes --timeout 1
Redelivered: true
Properties: {sn:1, ts:1414178091185765136, x-amqp-delivery-count:1}

0
{noformat}

The false receive attempts make the message look like it was already delivered, hence the Redelivered: true, first-acquirer absent and the x-amqp-delivery-count setting.

{noformat}
The client sends two closely spaced flow messages to the broker. They are identical except that the drain flag is false in Frame 97 but true in Frame 98. The broker responds in Frame 100 by advancing the delivery count to 1000 to drain the available credit.  Frames 101 and 102 are a repeat of the flow-with-drain from the client followed by the broker effecting the drain with an advanced delivery count.

The protocol error is that by AMQP 1.0 the sender receiving a flow with drain=true SHOULD send all available messages before advancing the delivery count to effect the drain.

Just a guess here but the broker looks like it starts to form a delivery for the message it has in the queue but can't deliver it because the drain behavior kicked in. That's why when the client finally gets the message it is 'redelivered'.

Since the behavior is marked with SHOULD and not with MUST then the drain behavior is probably acceptable. However, if the drain bypasses available messages then a user might expect that the messages would finally be delivered with Redelivered=false. ;;;","02/Apr/15 23:00;tabish;This is resolved with the addition of proper drain support.  ;;;","27/May/15 15:28;tabish;Found an issue with the credit handling after drain completes.;;;","27/May/15 15:32;tabish;Additional fix and tests added;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was added in AMQ-5002 as a workaround for a problem in some old message conversation code contributed to 'proton-jms', where the JMSExpiration value was being set to the TTL value from the AMQP message when these actually have different semantics and values. That defect was since resolved via PROTON-474 for inclusion in Proton 0.8. Now that AMQ-5346 is underway, that means we are using the updated proton-jms code and the workaround must be removed otherwise it causes various issues itself:

- It may set a timestamp value where none existed, which could lead to addition of a creation-time field on outbound AMQP messages, whereas the Properties section of the AMQP message is meant to be immutable.
- When setting JMSExpiration to 'new timestamp + old expiration', if the expiration was actually based on the absolute-expiry-time field of the incoming AMQP message then the new JMSExpiration value will be incorrect, much higher than actually requested and preventing the messages from expiring for years longer.",,robbie,tabish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMQ-5002,AMQ-5346,PROTON-474,,,,,,,,,"20/Oct/14 12:44;robbie;0001-AMQ-5403-remove-old-expiration-workaround-it-is-no-l.patch;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12675818/0001-AMQ-5403-remove-old-expiration-workaround-it-is-no-l.patch",,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Mon Oct 20 13:57:20 UTC 2014,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i21csf:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/Oct/14 12:44;robbie;Attaching patch to remove the relevant code.;;;","20/Oct/14 13:57;tabish;Patch applied, thanks!;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ActiveMQSession.java method afterRollback() @938 is triggered in this case. Which will redeliver the message by scheduling it:

connection.getScheduler().executeAfterDelay(new Runnable() {

The session is not blocked or otherwise stopped from processing more messages, so it does it.

Setting prefetch=1 for the consumer did not helped.

The root cause seems to be when KahaDB processes a ""duplicate"" update message command or if it processes an update message command after the message has been removed from kahadb.  The code in KahaDB logs a warning when this occurs from the following else statement and then updates the metadata location and then exits the function as shown below:

...
} else {
            LOG.warn(""Non existent message update attempt rejected. Destination: {}://{}, Message id: {}"", command.getDestination().getType(), command.getDestination().getName(), command.getMessageId());
        }
metadata.lastUpdate = location;
...

It turns out that the metadata.lastUpdate = location; line should not run if we took the else branch above so the simple fix is to move that line up into the if block so that it will not run after the log warning.  Once we did that, we no longer see the broker startup errors.  Note that this log warning does not always lead to a broker startup error as it is also related to writing at the end of a transaction log file or the checkpoint timer interval so it is not simple to reproduce but we have not see the startup error once the metadata.lastUpdate line was moved to the correct location.

Problem seems to be related with JDBCMessageStore.removeMessage method:
{code:java}
    public void removeMessage(ConnectionContext context, MessageAck ack) throws IOException {
    	long seq = persistenceAdapter.getStoreSequenceIdForMessageId(ack.getLastMessageId(), destination)[0];
...
{code}

Call to {{removeMessage}} already has one DB connection passed in {{context}} method parameter, but calling {{persistenceAdapter.getStoreSequenceIdForMessageId}} creates another DB connection in the same transaction.

Deadlock occurs when all DB connections are used by {{context}}, so that  {{removeMessage}} can't fetch its own connection.

Possible solution would be to pass {{ConnectionContext}} object to {{persistenceAdapter.getStoreSequenceIdForMessageId}} method, so that the method would reuse same connection.",AMQ 5.9.0 with Oracle 11.2 as persistent store.

This bug is triggered under a unique set of circumstances:
# A message is published by a JMS client with compression *_disabled_* on its {{ActiveMQConnection}}
# The message is consumed by a JMS client with compression *_enabled_* on its {{ActiveMQConnection}}
# The JMS consumer makes the received message writable in order to modify and reuse it:
{code}
message.setReadOnlyProperties(false);
message.setReadOnlyBody(false);
{code}
# The JMS consumer modifies the message, triggering a call to {{ActiveMQBytesMessage.initializeWriting()}}

The problem within {{ActiveMQBytesMessage.initializeWriting()}} is that the method determines whether the message should be compressed _when it is published_ (based on its current connection) BEFORE it has restored the message's original content.  In the example above, the message's original {{compressed}} flag is changed from {{false}} to {{true}}, resulting in {{restoreOldContent()}} trying to decompress message contents which were never compressed.

{code}
private void initializeWriting() throws JMSException {
        checkReadOnlyBody();
        if (this.dataOut == null) {
            this.bytesOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            OutputStream os = bytesOut;
            this.dataOut = new DataOutputStream(os);
        }

        // should compression be used when publishing this message??
        ActiveMQConnection connection = getConnection();
        if (connection != null && connection.isUseCompression()) {
            compressed = true;
        }

        // restore the message's old content
        restoreOldContent();
}
{code}

-A simple solution would be to move the {{restoreOldContent()}} method call before the {{connection.isUseCompression()}} conditional in {{ActiveMQBytesMessage.initializeWriting()}}.-

+Had a chance to look into this problem further.  The best fix would be to only set the 'compressed' flag when the message's 'contents' are stored, instead of whenever the message is initialized for writing.+",,brianjohnson,githubbot,tabish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,Wed Feb 11 10:43:38 UTC 2015,,,,,,,,,,,"0|i20q9r:",9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"03/Oct/14 14:04;tabish;Recommend you create a JUnit test case to reproduce your problem so that any fix is sure to be preserved in the future.;;;","10/Oct/14 12:48;githubbot;GitHub user letM3in opened a pull request:

Also, the value of the remote link credit will be respected if set.;;;","14/Oct/14 16:35;robbie;I just came across the update on http://activemq.apache.org/amqp.html which notes regarding the prefetch config toggle ""that the same value will be used for broker-side amqp receiver link that handles incoming messages"". This is probably going to lead to people accidently reducing the producer credit window to smaller values, which will then hammer producer performance, since even the default value of 100 is likely to be limiting in certain cases already. I would suggest adding a seperate config toggle to alter the credit window for producers independently from the vaue used for consumers.;;;","14/Oct/14 16:47;robbie;Separately, the consumer prefetching has some issues from an AMQP perspective, possibly due to a bit of a mismatch between how the internal consumer prefetch handling of the broker works (being set to a particular size window initially), and how the explicit handling of credit in AMQP 1.0 works (consumers explicitly grant/retract credit for the server to use to send messages, as and when appropriate to satisfy the consumer clients needs).

From an AMQP perspective, a consumer can attach without any credit initiall, then grant it later when it is deemed appropriate to receive messages, and also retract it to ensure it doesnt get any messages during a period when it doesnt want any. These behaviours could be combined to implement 0-prefetch synchronous recieve for example. Currently it would seem that due to the default prefetch value the broker may send messages to the client in cases where it hasnt yet 'asked' (provided any credit) for them, or in cases where it has asked not to get any more until further notice, which could cause problems. It is possible that Proton will handlethis, by buffering all the messages that there is not credit to send, which in itself could cause problems later or lead to some interesting memory usage.;;;","21/Oct/14 13:30;dejanb;Hi [~gemmellr]], thanks for these comments. It totally makes sense to do these changes. I pushed a commit that now configures producer side with the producerCredit property. On the other hand, the size of activemq consumer prefetch is dynamically set using the credit supplied in the link flow.

https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/ab3de0c4c2b8af83090558ebbea4ef91ce04024b

Can you take a look at it and see if does what I mean it does. As link flow is sent for every message, I change the prefetch only after credit  reaches 0 and if it's different value than the one we have at the moment.

All tests work with this change, but as there are no way to customise the prefetch with current proton jms client, I couldn't test more advanced scenarios.;;;","22/Oct/14 12:46;robbie;Given his familiarity with the broker as a whole, [~tabish121] is possibly in a better position to comment overall on how the changes will work with the broker generally. That said, in terms of the AMQP related code change:

The new 'producerCredit' field in AmqpProtocolConverter is only being used during the initial opening of the producer (i.e proton receiver object). The existing 'prefetch' field value is still being used to replenish the producers credit when it gets used up later by incoming messages, which may mean the wrong amount of credit will be granted if the config values differ, so that process also needs update to use the producerCredit field.

The 'client preference' check here should probably be removed. The producer doesn't really get a say in the credit they are given from the server/receiver, any link credit value they set in a Flow frame is a reflection of the last value they know based on Flows sent to them from the server. AmqpProtocolConverter, Line 824:
{noformat}
        // Client is producing to this receiver object
        org.apache.qpid.proton.amqp.transport.Target remoteTarget = receiver.getRemoteTarget();
        int flow = producerCredit;
        // use client's preference if set
        if (receiver.getRemoteCredit() != 0) {
            flow = receiver.getRemoteCredit();
        }
{noformat}


Slight aside: Flow frames dont need to be sent after processing every message. Some clients may do that currently but when attention turns to efficiency and performance, adjusting the credit in batches and only sending the Flows more sparingly is what most will lkely do.

I think the updated consumer prefetch handling should work in a more AMQP-like fashion in more cases, though I'm not sure if it yet fully handles the desire of a consumer to completely stop message delivery by moving the link credit back down to 0 (e.g using the flow drain flag, or by simply not replenishing credit as it is used for earlier consumed messages), and it may lead to some weirdness around configuring the ActiveMQ consumer prefetch repeatedly to a different values which are lower than the currently outstanding number of already prefetched messages. The main thing I wonder around that is, how would the broker as a whole react to reducing the ActiveMQ consumer prefetch setting below the number of messages that are already prefetched?

(also, the null on the context is redundant since instanceof check handles that)
{noformat}
+    protected void processLinkFlow(Link link) throws Exception {
+        Object context = link.getContext();
+        int credit = link.getRemoteCredit();
+        if (context != null && context instanceof ConsumerContext) {
+            ConsumerContext consumerContext = (ConsumerContext)context;
+            // change ActiveMQ consumer prefetch if needed
+            if (consumerContext.credit == 0 && consumerContext.consumerPrefetch != credit && credit > 0) {
+                ConsumerControl control = new ConsumerControl();
+                control.setConsumerId(consumerContext.consumerId);
+                control.setDestination(consumerContext.destination);
+                control.setPrefetch(credit);
+                consumerContext.consumerPrefetch = credit;
+                sendToActiveMQ(control, null);
+            }
+            consumerContext.credit = credit;
+        }
+        ((AmqpDeliveryListener) link.getContext()).drainCheck();
+    }
{noformat}

Perhaps confusingly, the link Flow event is raised by Proton for reasons other than simply receiving a Flow frame for the link, and incoming flow frames may not actually change the credit (but could effectively add or remote some), so this method may execute for a sending link even without a credit change. Using link.getRemoteCredit() doesnt return the amount of credit previously given by the remote receiver, but rather calculates the currently unused amount by doing '<remaining unused credit> - <messages still queued to send by procesing the transport>' (which I'm not certain of, but seems like it could even be negative if more messages have already attempted to be sent than there is now actually remaining credit for, which I believe makes proton buffer them). As a result, if all of the originally existing link credit had been used by prefetching at this point, only some of that amount of credit has been replenished so far by the remote receiver, link.getRemoteCredit() will presumably yeild a smaller number than the original credit window was, which could make it set the ActiveMQ consumer prefetch to this lower-than-previous value if consumerContext.credit has previously been recorded as 0 while the credit was all used. At this point <up to original credit window> messages may already be prefetched and still awaiting actual consumption, though the ActiveMQ prefetch may now set to a smaller value, only the as-yet-unused remaining AMQP credit. How would the broker react to that? Further, if that credit is then also used, and 'remote credit' hits 0 again, and the client subsequently Flows new credit as it consumes earlier messages, that could lead to 'remote credit' changing again to a different non-zero value than previously, possibly being used to update the ActiveMQ consumer prefetch again to match. This is to say, it could lead to the ActiveMQ consumer prefetch continuously being configured to new values whenever the available AMQP credit changes after previously being all used for a time.

In terms of testing, later releases of the 'old' Qpid AMQP 1.0 JMS client do let you configure the consumer prefetch, though the way of configuring SSL seems to have changed so other tests might need updated to update to using such a release. It would probably even be useful to test the prefetch related behaviour of the broker at a lower level, perhaps suing the proton engine directly, in order to get more fine grained control over the protocol interactions, though that is probably a task for later :);;;","27/Nov/14 14:08;dejanb;Thanks for the comments Robbie. 

The latest commit have the following changes:

- now using producerCredit instead of prefetch in all places related to the producer
- I bumped the default prefetch (and producer credit value) to 1000
- We decided to simplify things in terms of prefetch and credit, as currently we can't control it fully. The user can set the value for the prefetch on the transport connector and if it does it will be used and not changed. If the value is not set, the consumer will use default value until we get the first flow and initial client preference. We will use that value afterwards and not change it. I think this is good enough for the most current use cases. We can refine logic later with the real use cases.
- The problem with redelivery flag on the messages being set is fixed, as we now track the last delivered sequence id and inform the broker on consumer close;;;","02/Dec/14 12:08;robbie;Hi Dejan,

I think we need to change how the credit is observed after the initial flow, patch attached. As AMQPProtocolConverter could create the 'ActiveMQ consumer' with a 1000 msg prefetch (if we havent already also had a Flow before the Attach actually gets processed), it is likely it could buffer up to that many messages sends before we ever get a Flow, at which point the way the credit is currently observed (via getRemoteCredit()) wont actually give the amount of credit we received but rather what is currently believed to be left unused after accounting for buffered messages, leading us to underestimate the actual prefetch (it could even be negative if it already buffered sends for more messages than the actual received credit). I think getCredit() seems to be what to use instead.

Having said all that, I am now also thinking that a better way to go for now might be creating the 'ActiveMQ consumer' with 0 prefetch until the first flow arrives, and then giving it that much prefetch, since the AMQP consumer cant/wont actually be sent any messages over the wire until it gives the broker/proton credit anyway. This would help with multiple consumers etc by avoiding the 'ActiveMQ consumers' prefetching lots of messages they cant actually transmit to the AMQP consumer yet.

The above may possibly make the general issue underlying AMQ-5453 a little worse, since the 'ActiveMQ consumer' wouldnt have any 'advance credit' to use to get messages buffered ready to send before a 'drain' flow occurs. As it is currently almost entirely broken anyway, I'm not sure this would really be much more of an issue than already exists, which will still need a general fix either way. A possible saving grace in this specific case though is that I see that client is sending two flows, one with drain false then one with it true, which might still appear to work occasionally if messages get sent inbetween them.

I think the changes here mean that anyone using ClientAcknowledge with the JMS clients will find it isnt able to recieve more messages than the consumers configured prefetch size within a single ack window, since the desire for more messages is communicated by granting more credit, which would now have no effect. That in itself isnt necessarily worse than it was in ActiveMQ 5.10, which had an internal fixed window of 100 messages, the only difference is that if AMQP clients set their prefetch down below the old fixed 100 (e.g, to 1) they then wont be able to exceed that, whereas previously they would have apparently been able to since up to 99 messages would have actually been buffered awaiting the new credit. I guess that by using the new 'transport.prefetch' config to set a value will essentially force it to behave as it did previously, which may be a workaround in some cases.

When looking an issue relating to transactions, I came across the 'prefetch extension' concept in PrefetchSubscription. It currently looks to mainly use acknowlegement of specific messages to operate, but perhaps it could be modified to use credit (since we cant tell which specific messages, if any, that incoming credit may have been previously associated with) and help toward enabling things to work more along the lines of expectation for AMQP.

Sorry for writing another book size comment, I really dont mean to when I start :P

Robbie;;;","02/Dec/14 14:06;tabish;I'd agree with Robbie's analysis here.  I think we should investigate whether we really need to be jumping the gun on granting prefetch instead of waiting for the client to tell us what it wants.  ;;;","02/Dec/14 15:26;dejanb;Yeah, I also agree with it. The thing is that when I was trying to do that against 0.26 clients, I never got any flow from the client until I send something to it first. Also, setting the prefetch using transport.prefetch option is only for this legacy client as well. We have users that want to use 0.26 clients and control the prefetch, so that's the only way I managed to make it work.

Let me try to write some test that demonstrates this initial prefetch 0 problem with 0.26 client, and maybe we can give it a more thought on how to make it work.;;;","02/Dec/14 15:43;tabish;Can we just encourage them to move onto a later QPid client release as I think that problem is addressed along with other fixes and improvements in later releases.  I've been testing out 0.30+ and been having good luck with a minor problem with QueueBrowsers that I'm trying to track down.  ;;;","04/Dec/14 11:46;dejanb;I pushed the change that sets zero prefetch when nothing else is specified, and then use the first flow packet to adjust it. After upgrade to qpid 0.30 [AMQ-5405], all tests looks good. The commit also contains Robbie's patch.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have tracked this to a defect in the proton-jms contrib artifact and corrected it via PROTON-704, for inclusion in Proton 0.8.

The issue can be seen in the below snippets of protocol trace (at the lines marked <<<<<). When the message is first transfered to the client, the delivery count field is null / not set, giving the default value of 0. Later when the message is sent again after a rollback, the delivery-count header has incremented to 2 rather than 1.

I'm using version ActiveMQ 5.8, but it occurs on 5.9, 5.10 versions as well

doing some profiling, it showed up that the SSL handshake on broker side eats up ~90% of overall CPU time
by checking just the handshake status in very high frequency

top 3 methods sorted by own processor time:
com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.getHandshakeStatus()
org.apache.activemq.transport.nio.NIOSSLTransport.doHandshake()
com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.getHSStatus(javax.net.ssl.SSLEngineResult$HandshakeStatus)

the reason is the asynchronous nature of the SSL handshake with NIO, especially the execution of delegated tasks:
- NIOSSLTransport.doHandshake() executes delegated tasks using a TaskRunnerFactory asynchronously
- in the meantime it loops calling SSLEngine.getHandshakeStatus()

to improve the situation I did the following changes:
- run delegated tasks synchronously in method doHandshake (handshake status NEED_TASK) instead of asynchronously
- added some small wait cycles in method secureRead as there is not always data available with NIO (to further reduce the number of calls to SSLEngine.getHandshakeStatus)

after these changes the SSL handshake for several thousand connections in parallel was not a problem anymore

There's a new ""test"" NIOSSLLoadTest.testConnectionHandshakeLoad() which could be used to monitor and profile broker behaviour in this scenario. It's ignored by default, as it will be problematic to run in CI.;;;","11/Jul/15 11:07;tabish;I've noticed that since this fix went in there are intermittent test failures in the STOMP module in Jenkins around NIO tests and handshake timeouts, might be worth a look. ;;;","13/Jul/15 11:38;dejanb;Thanks Tim, I had an unrealistic selector read timeout during handshake.

uses soTimeout value or blocks forever if that value is not set. This should help with the test in slow environments.

I've made some good progress with this.  I've ripped out Jetty 8 and updated to the latest Jetty 9.2 and I updated all of the tests in activemq-http.  I'm working on updating the spring config now for the web console and testing that out.  A couple things though:

- Do we need to use the gernomio spec jars?  Jetty 9.2 needs the servlet 3.1 spec jar and I only see a 3.0 geronimo version.
- Is anyone using the Krb5AndCertsSslSocketConnector?

The Geronimo spec jars use an Apache license, others may be GPL which we cannot use, it may be necessary to contact the Geronimo project to request a 3.1 release similar to what the was needed for Artemis with the JMS 2.0 spec jar.  

2. I don't know if anyone is using that or not, given there is not tests we don't even know if it works now.  I'd guess it's not broadly used but I couldn't say for sure.  It could be removed as broken in a 5.13 release and anyone who really needs that could contribute something that works with Jetty 9 if they really wanted to update their broker and relied on that feature.;;;","17/Aug/15 21:19;cshannon;Ok, thanks I figured it was an Apache license issue.

In that case, messages can be assigned to receivers, the broker can be restarted, and then the messages are re-assigned to receivers and do not include the JMSRedelivered flag as expected.  I will attach a unit test and proposed fix to illustrate the problem.

Also, here is additional information I had sent to the mailing list:
When using the new option persisteJMSRedelivered (to ensure the redelivered flag is set correctly on potentially duplicate messages that are re-dispatched by the broker even after a restart): <policyEntry queue="">"" persistJMSRedelivered=""true""></policyEntry>

there is still a case where a message can be re-sent and will not be marked as redelivered.  I can open a JIRA and probably create a unit test but it is pretty clear from the pasted code below where the exception is getting swallowed.  Would the preferred fix be to update the broker interface and make preProcessDispatch throw an IOException or would it be better to add a new field to the MessageDispatch class to indicate an exception occurred and leave the interface alone?

The specific case when this can happen is when a MessageStore returns an exception during the updateMessage call, which then gets swallowed (and an ERROR logged) and still allows the message to be dispatched to the consumer.  The exception seems like it should actually propagate out of the preProcessDispatch function in RegionBroker as shown below, but this would require changing the Broker interface and making the void preProcessDispatch function throw an IOException.

Indeed it normally takes only a few ms. in my application. But sometimes the ActiveMQQueueBrowser hangs for up to 30 seconds at method before returning!

When the issue occurs, the loop in hasMoreElements() calls waitForMessage() multiple times which times out after 2s at semaphore.wait(2000) without receiving any message from the broker. I found that when the broker's background job that checks for expired messages runs, the browser happens to be woken even if there are no expired messages. So setting the expireMessagesPeriod to a low value (e.g. 200ms) is a good workaround for this issue, but this is quite brittle because it uses internal broker implementation that may not even be related to the issue!

To reproduce:

- (this is what I do in my application) create a queue, send a few message with an expiration time of 10 seconds and repeatedly browse it until it is empty. If I browse the queue after these 10 seconds have passed, the issue occurs!

Your issue is that you are using a transaction and you never call commit so your messages are never acknowledged by the broker.  Since your messages are never acknowledged, hasMoreElements() will always return true because the QueueBrowser is never notified that it is done browsing until the expire messages task runs and removes the messages.

In your test on line 115 when you create your session, if you change {{connection.createSession(true, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)}} to {{connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE}} then your test will immediately finish and not hang.

 If you still want to use a transaction then you need to call commit on the session after you get each element or hasMoreElements() is never going to finish.  So you would change your loop to:

{code:java}
while (enumeration.hasMoreElements()) {
	TextMessage m = (TextMessage) enumeration.nextElement();
	browsed++;
        session.commit();

What is very weird is that the issue still remains in my actual application. I am using standalone Spring (3.2.5.RELEASE, no J2EE container). I use the browseSelected method of a org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate that is configured with an ActiveMQConnectionFactory. As is the default, it does not use a transaction and it uses auto acknowledge.

Problem also remains when I set sessionTransacted to true on the JmsTemplate and call commit after fetching each message.;;;","22/Jun/15 16:58;cshannon;[~slowstrider],

That is odd because it should work fine.  I just modified your example to use a JmsTemplate and browseSelected to browse the queue and everything works as expected and finishes in less than 1 second.

- set a time to live of 1 second for the messages that are sent
- set expireMessagesPeriod to 10 seconds
- repeatedly browse the queue until it is empty, sleeping for 100ms in between

[~gtully] and [~tabish121],

This is another interesting issue relating to expired messages.  The problem with this test case is the messages are added to the subscription to be dispatched but when the subscription goes to dispatch them the logic detects the messages are expired so the QueueBrowser client never gets any messages.  Unfortunately, since the QueueBrowser never receives any messages it never sends back any acks and acks are what trigger the logic to send a NULL_MESSAGE signaling the browser is done.  This happens in the iterate method in Queue.

So basically the QueueBrowser needs some way to know that it will never receive any messages.  The QueueBrowser already calls off to waitForMessage() in the hasMoreElements() so using the pullCommand might work here as that would trigger the NULL_MESSAGE to get sent back.  However, right now a pull command is never sent if prefetch is greater than 0.;;;","24/Jun/15 07:16;slowstrider;When the queue has no messages at all the browser returns immediately. This is true before sending any message as well as after the expired messages have been removed by the background job.;;;","25/Jun/15 10:06;gtully;[~christopher.l.shannon]  - it does not make sense to me that a queue browser would check expiry, it should get a snapshot of messages from its creation time.
maybe the simplest thing is to make the expiry check from org.apache.activemq.broker.region.PrefetchSubscription#dispatchPending conditional on not being a browser:                                
{code} if (!isBrowser()  && node!=QueueMessageReference.NULL_MESSAGE && node.isExpired()) {{code}
;;;","25/Jun/15 13:03;cshannon;[~gtully],

I agree, not checking expiry for browsers makes sense.  This almost works but it appears there is something else that would need to be changed too...The problem is when running the test case against this change, the last run breaks.  The {{enumeration.hasMoreElements()}} returns true but the only thing pending is the NULL control message so then {{enumeration.nextElement()}} returns null.  It's detecting that no new messages were added in the iterate() method in Queue and calling brwoser.decrementQueueRef() which sends the NULL control message.  I haven't looked at it yet to figure out why it's doing that.;;;","06/Jul/15 11:50;githubbot;GitHub user cshannon opened a pull request:

    A QueueBrowser no longer checks expiry on messages to prevent a
    browser from hanging in between the hasMoreElements check and actually
    getting a message.  This means that if messages were in the queue when
    the browser started it will receive messages even if they are now
    expired. Even though the browser will get the expired message, the
    broker will still expire it to prevent future access to it.

In our environment we observe that ActiveMQ process cpu usage is continually climbing and that the ConcurrentLinkedQueue in the AdvisoryBroker grows indefinitely.

The ConcurrentLinkedQueue is a non-blocking concurrent FIFO datastructure provided by the core Java Development Kit API starting from Java 5. 
AdvisoryBroker use offer() method to add a new consumer in the ConcurrentLinkedQueue, and remove() method to remove it.
When the consumer removed is the last element of the queue, the Consumer object is nulled but a node remain in the queue. The null node is then never garbage collected. This is true only for the last element of the queue. Any other element is removed safely.

{code}


In the org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.DefaultJDBCAdapter#doDropTables() it explicitly calls connection.commit() without checking if auto-commit is enabled.  In other places auto-commit does seem to be checked before commit is called  - org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.TransactionContext#commit().

The v12 driver does allow  autocommit-SpecCompliance to be turned off by setting system property ""oracle.jdbc.autoCommitSpecCompliant=false"". But it does seem like org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.DefaultJDBCAdapter#doDropTables() is not strictly adhering to the spec. 

I think it would be better to do a check if auto-commit is on before calling connection.commit(). 


I will attach a github pull request with test and potential fix - for someone to review.

The intermittent was tracked down to being a connection error that does not get properly recovered. 

I have recreated the problem in a very small example by creating a Camel 
consumer route that retrieves messages from a JMS queue and writes the text message to a log.   

        from(TEST_QUEUE).routeId(TEST_QUEUE).convertBodyTo(String.class) 
             .log(LoggingLevel.INFO, loggerName, ""Request Received "");
 
  The connection string used is 
  failover:(tcp://serverd05.company.com:26093?keepAlive=true)?jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0
   
Please note that polling is being used when the prefetch size is set to 0. 

I then use Hawtio on the ActiveMQ broker to add some text messages to the queue. It works fine.
 
I then stop the Client Connector on the ActiveMQ broker side to simulate a 
broken connection on the consumer side. (The broker must be remote to the consumer or the error will not occur.)  The client logs show that an 
EOFException is caught and the connection is reestablished. The connection also appears on the ActiveMQ broker. it only looks good though. Sending new text messages to the queue will not be processed. They will just sit there.  There are no errors or warnings logged on either the consumer or broker servers. Restarting the consumer will cause the messages to get processed. The reconnection only intermittently fails. I find is much more like to occur if 10 minutes pass from the previous message being processed. 

I turned on trace=yes in the connection string and found the root cause is the PullMessage commands are occasionally not being issued after a reconnect.  On cases where it works, the log shows that the PullMessage commands do reinstate. 

I am wondering if this might be a race condition, as this problem only showed up when the consumer was on fast servers

;;;","07/Aug/14 20:12;wayn23;I have read through the referenced JMS-to-JMS-Bridge-Conenction article, but I don't think it is related, although what is in common is it is triggered by a broken connection.  In this JIRA scope the reconnection is made successfully and remains connected as expected.  The connection can be explored with JMX on both the consumer and broker sides.  The only problem is the PullMessage command is never issued after the reconnect, so no actual messages are pulled.  The keepAlive=true option is used and the keepAlive commands are sent across the connection with no problem.  The root problem is something is intermittently not happening to establish the issuing of PullMessage commands after a reconnect ;;;","16/Sep/14 20:22;wayn23;Narrowed problem down to the use a LinkedHashMap as a MessageCache in the ConsumerStateTracker class in ActiveMQ.  
The LinkedHashMap has a special method called removeEldestEntry that is called whenever a new entry is put into the HashMap.  In IBM JRE, this is called every time an entry is added to the HashMap, regardless if the key already exists or not.  In Oracle JRE, this method is only invoked if the key value being added is new (which in a polling config is always the same key for polling command).
When the removeEldestEntry is invoked and the external field currentCacheSize exceeds 128K, it would automatically remove the oldest entry in the list.  In ActiveMQ 5.9.0, the field currentCacheSize was being grown by 400 bytes for every polling call to a queue (so 1 per second) regardless of whether adding a new entry to the queue or not.  Once the currentCacheSize exceeded 128K (after about 6 mins), the removeEldestEntry method in the IBM JRE would start to remove the eldest entry which in a polling state was the entry just inserted (so the message cache would be 0 entries in size and when a disconnect occurs, it wouldn't replay the PullCommands that were needed to resume the polling).  In the Oracle JRE, the removeEldestEntry was not being invoked because the pullMessage command was not a new entry.
Regardless of the scenario above, a change was made in ActiveMQ 5.9.1 in that the currentCacheSize only grows by 400 bytes on the first poll, so, now the currentCache size only grows with additional polling consumers instead of after each poll.  Moving the ActiveMQ client to 5.9.1 will longer exhibit the issue with the Polling Consumer not resuming polling, as the removeEldestEntry will not remove the eldest entry until we exceed 320 polling consumers (as opposed to before, where it would remove the entry with just 1 entry in the cache after 6 mins of time).;;;","16/Sep/14 20:24;wayn23;A change was made in ActiveMQ 5.9.1 in that the currentCacheSize was only being grown by 400 on the first poll, so, now the currentCache size only grows with additional polling consumers instead of after each poll itself.

    Fix for AMQ-5306

    Cleaned up logic around the use of comma separated destinations, sysTest.totalDests and producer.destComposite. The logic is as follows:
    
    Given -Dproducer.destName=foo:
    default (-DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 1 destination - foo
    
    -DsysTest.totalDests=2
    * publishes to 2 destinations - foo.0, foo.1
    
    Given -Dproducer.destName=foo,cheese:
    default (-Dproducer.destComposite=false -DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 2 destinations - foo and cheese
    
    (-Dproducer.destComposite=false) -DsysTest.totalDests=2
    * publishes to 4 destinations - foo.0, foo.1 and cheese.0, cheese.1
    
    -Dproducer.destComposite=true (-DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 1 composite destination - ""foo,cheese""
    
    -Dproducer.destComposite=true -DsysTest.totalDests=2

The groupClass attribute is set on the TempDestinationAuthorizationEntry instance but we don't apply the groupClass to the AuthorizationEntry by calling afterPropertiesSet();

As a result, authorization fails when trying to create a temp destination. 
This can happen when deploying the broker inside a Karaf container and have Karaf do the authentication (such as in JBoss A-MQ). 
The groupClass is properly set on the authorizationEntries within the <authorizationEntries> list and only fails to be applied properly on the tempDestinationAuthorizationEntry.

Inifinite loop when attempting to replay levelDB logs to rebuild index,AMQ-5300,12730988,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

To work around the serialization issue (AMQ-5284), I deleted the index snapshots from the LevelDB datastore. This will replay the logs to regenerate the index. However, if a log rotation has already occurred, you will get an infinite loop upon restart.

Here are the steps to reproduce what I am seeing:

Configure ActiveMQ 5.10.0 to use a LevelDB data store with the log size of about 1MB.
{code}
<persistenceAdapter>
    <levelDB directory=""${activemq.data}/leveldb"" logSize=""1000000"" />
</persistenceAdapter>
{code}

Then I started up the broker and published 10,000 persistent messages to a queue, causing the log files to rotate (twice in my case). I see the following files in the data store folder:
{code}
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000071 Jul 30 11:15 0000000000000000.log
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000009 Jul 30 11:16 00000000000f4287.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:16 00000000001e84d0.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000000 Jul 30 11:17 00000000001e84d0.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 dirty.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users       0 Jul 30 11:11 lock
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 plist.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users      24 Jul 30 11:11 store-version.txt
{code}

I then consume 5,000 messages, which causes the first log to be deleted since it is no longer being referenced. I see the following log statements:
{code}
2014-07-30 11:29:14,960 | DEBUG | Log no longer referenced: 0 | org.apache.activemq.leveldb.LevelDBClient | Thread-2
2014-07-30 11:29:14,967 | DEBUG | Deleting log at 0 | org.apache.activemq.leveldb.LevelDBClient | Thread-2
{code}

And I see the remaining files in the data store folder (notice the 0000000000000000.log is gone):
{code}
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000009 Jul 30 11:16 00000000000f4287.log
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000011 Jul 30 11:29 00000000001e84d0.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:29 00000000002dc71b.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000000 Jul 30 11:29 00000000002dc71b.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 dirty.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users       0 Jul 30 11:11 lock
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 plist.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users      24 Jul 30 11:11 store-version.txt
{code}

At this point, I shut down the broker and here is the listing of what's left in the data store:
{code}
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000009 Jul 30 11:16 00000000000f4287.log
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000011 Jul 30 11:29 00000000001e84d0.log
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users 1000000 Jul 30 11:29 00000000002dc71b.log
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:36 0000000000301737.index
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 dirty.index
drwxrwxr-x. 2 user users    4096 Jul 30 11:11 plist.index
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user users      24 Jul 30 11:11 store-version.txt
{code}

I then delete the index folder within the data store (in my case ""0000000000301737.index""). I am doing this to force a replay of the logs to regenerate the index (due to the serialization issue I ran into).

And finally, this is the message I am getting once I start the broker back up (infinite loop of this same message, and I have to shut down the broker):

It seems this issue is not fixed as I have been able to replicated on Replicated Level DB and the lastest 5.11 snapshot. The levelDB corrupts even at the point that every time I kill current master the next slave to take the position starts doing the infinite loop. The only way to fix this is to delete the leveldb data from all ActiveMQ instances which obviously lets me without messages. I find this issue to be quite critical as it occurs even on graceful shut downs of ActiveMQ.

I have a attached a copy of the logs and my levelDB directory. (If all messages on the Queue look the same is because they are, for testing purposes i send the same message over and over)

HTTPS Network Connector doesn't work with Mutual authentication- HTTPSClientTransport uses wrong SSLSocketFactory,AMQ-5295,12730591,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

The problem is here:
{code}
    private SchemeRegistry createSchemeRegistry() {

        SchemeRegistry schemeRegistry = new SchemeRegistry();
        try {
            // register the default socket factory so that it looks at the javax.net.ssl.keyStore,
            // javax.net.ssl.trustStore, etc, properties by default
            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory =
                    new SSLSocketFactory((javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory) javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.getDefault(),
                    SSLSocketFactory.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER);
            schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme(""https"", getRemoteUrl().getPort(), sslSocketFactory));
            return schemeRegistry;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Failure trying to create scheme registry"", e);
        }
    }
{code}

The problem with that code is, that it never take SSLSocketFactory from spring context. So the one defined in XML is ignored.

So it's code have to be replaced with:

{code}
    private SchemeRegistry createSchemeRegistry() {

        SchemeRegistry schemeRegistry = new SchemeRegistry();
        try {
            // register the default socket factory so that it looks at the javax.net.ssl.keyStore,
            // javax.net.ssl.trustStore, etc, properties by default
            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = createSocketFactory();
            schemeRegistry.register(new Scheme(""https"", getRemoteUrl().getPort(), sslSocketFactory));
            return schemeRegistry;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Failure trying to create scheme registry"", e);
        }
    }
{code}

And then new method should be added:

{code}
    /**
     * Creates a new SSL SocketFactory. The given factory will use user-provided
     * key and trust managers (if the user provided them).
     *
     * @return Newly created (Ssl)SocketFactory.
     * @throws IOException
     */
    protected SocketFactory createSocketFactory() throws IOException {
        if (SslContext.getCurrentSslContext() != null) {
            SslContext ctx = SslContext.getCurrentSslContext();
            try {
                return ctx.getSSLContext().getSocketFactory();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw IOExceptionSupport.create(e);
            }
        } else {
            return SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        }

    }
{code}

This is consistent solution with other transports.

I will prepare patches and tests for this scenerio.

Currently, all the TCP based transports are using the old blocking style of socket.accept() to accept connections.   This works ""OK"" except that for sockets that have a channel associated with them, the socket.close() doesn't cause it to return immediately.  It still waits for the SoTimeout which is currently set a 2 seconds.   That can cause 2 second delays for any shutdown which causes long, unnecessary delays, particularly in the tests.

One possible ""fix"" is to drop the socket.setSoTimeout(2000) call to something much smaller.   However, that would turn the accept thread into a more ""busy wait"" scenario which is undesirable.

A better fix is to change the accepts for the sockets that have a ServerSocketChannel to use the NIO based selectors for the accept operations.   The selector.disable()/selector.close() allows the socket and everything to close immediately.  The result is that the NIO based tests now take the same amount of time as the non-NIO based tests (for which socket.close() causes the accept to return immediately).

One of our tests which uses binding of *PooledConnectionFactory* into JNDI (tomcat-naming) got *stuck* and computes *in endless loop*.

Problem is implementation of interface {{org.apache.activemq.jndi.JNDIStorableInterface}} in class {{org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory}}:
- method {{populateProperties(Properties props)}} implementation uses {{IntrospectionSupport.getProperties(...)}} in order to set properties for all getters,
- setting properties works for basic types, but causes stack overflow for getters - {{getReference()}} and {{getProperties()}} which creates recursion loops
- loop #1: PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.populateProperties -> IntrospectionSupport.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties
- loop #2: PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.populateProperties -> IntrospectionSupport.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.getReference -> JNDIReferenceFactory.createReference -> PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties
- additional info: recursion loop doesn't end with StackOverflowError, but InvocationTargetException is propagated to IntrospectionSupport.getProperties method where it is being ignored and causes ""almost endless"" computation (exponential complexity)

Example test without using JNDI, but using key methods showing the problem and its possible solution/workaround for AMQ 5.10.0 is attached.

Anyway I have some notes that might be considered:
- exactly same problem is for class {{org.apache.activemq.pool.XaPooledConnectionFactory}} (it uses IntrospectionSupport as well in method populateProperties)
- my example might confuse you about property names - originally Gary Tully use ""pool"" prefix for the properties ({{org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory.POOL_PROPS_PREFIX}}), the prefix probably should remain,
- more on prefix: I would like ""pool."" (with dot at the end) more as it is used elsewhere (for example when parsing destination policies -> {{org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory.populateProperties(Properties)}});;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

;;;","04/May/15 19:43;thammoud;Hello,

I do still see the problem in 5.11.1. The culprit is destinationObjectNameMap which is being used for both inbound and outbound messages.  A destination that is put from the onInBoundMessage gets trashed by the one put from the onOutBoundMessage. The cleanup code in the stop() method will clean only one MBean instance leaving the other one dangling. 

My setup is as follows:

Two Networked Brokers (Full Duplex) (A and B). Two clients each publishing on the same exact topic. Each client is connected to exactly one of the brokers. Kill Broker B. Restart Broker B. On reconnect, you will see the error in Broker A.

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5265

    This is a revision of AMQ-5265 -- the original fix didn't quite clean up all of the mbeans that MBeanBridgeDestination created, as [noted in the original issue by Tarek Hammoud](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5265?focusedCommentId=14527137&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14527137).  The key for the map used to track the ObjectNames was an ActiveMQDestination (which uses the destination's physical name for its equals() implementation) caused the inbound and outbound entries in the map to randomly replace each other.
    
    Like Tarek, I could reproduce this issue using 5.11.1 with two networked brokers (full duplex) with a client publishing to a topic.  After I restart a broker, the logs on the non-restarted broker show the MBeanBridgeDestination reporting many InstanceAlreadyExistsExceptions when trying to register the unintentionally-duplicated mbeans.
    
    Please let me know if this makes sense or if there are any changes you would suggest (ex: is there a reasonable way or an example I could follow to add a unit test for something like this?).  Thanks!

{noformat}

Digging around on the forums and the issue tracker, the work around seems to add a parameter to the URI (Ex - tcp://localhost:60606?daemon=true).  

According to this StackOverflow posting (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213340/what-is-daemon-thread-in-java) which quotes from Java Concurrency in Practice 

* When a new thread is created it inherits the daemon status of its parent.
* Normal thread and daemon threads differ in what happens when they exit. When the JVM halts any remaining daemon threads are abandoned: **finally blocks are not executed**, stacks are not unwound - JVM just exits. Due to this reason daemon threads should be used sparingly and it is dangerous to use them for tasks that might perform any sort of I/O.

So, making the Socket that connects the JMS Queue Bridge a Daemon thread, seems to be the wrong solution.  

I was trying to debug the initialization of ActiveMQ, and noticed the org.apache.activemq.network.jms.JmsConnector class has a stop() method on it.  I believe this class creates the connection for the JMS Bridge, right?  If so, the stop method does not seem to shutdown the connection properly. 

{code}
public void stop() throws Exception {

        if (started.compareAndSet(true, false)) {

            ThreadPoolUtils.shutdown(connectionSerivce);
            connectionSerivce = null;

            for (DestinationBridge bridge : inboundBridges) {
                bridge.stop();
            }
            for (DestinationBridge bridge : outboundBridges) {
                bridge.stop();
            }
            LOG.info(""JMS Connector {} stopped"", getName());
        }
        
}
{code}

The question I have is why is the stop() method relying on the ThreadPoolUtils.shutdown(connectionSerivce) and NOT calling close() on the Connections first? For example:

{code}
public void stop() throws Exception {

        if (started.compareAndSet(true, false)) {

			foreignConnection.get().close();
			localConnection.get().close();
			
            ThreadPoolUtils.shutdown(connectionSerivce);
            connectionSerivce = null;

            for (DestinationBridge bridge : inboundBridges) {
                bridge.stop();
            }
            for (DestinationBridge bridge : outboundBridges) {
                bridge.stop();
            }
            LOG.info(""JMS Connector {} stopped"", getName());
        }
        
}
{code}
It was a little difficult to follow the code, so I may be missing something.  BUT shouldn't the connections close first?  Or am I looking in the wrong place.  

I have created a small project that creates this scenario.
https://github.com/pminearo/activemq-shutdown-bug.git

This was done with ActiveMQ 5.9.  Though, since this bug has been around for quite some time, it most likely is still in 5.10, 5.11, and 6.0.

The only issue we have seen is this hanging resource.  So, cleaning up the resources properly would fix the issue and make the use of Camel no longer a needed option.  Are there more technical reasons to not use the JMS Bridge the way it is set up in the Test project I included?  Is this functionality a legacy spec and no longer supported?  Did it change in 6.0? etc?

Connection reference leak in PooledConnectionFactory leading to expired connections stuck in the pool,AMQ-5258,12725221,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

{code:java}
    public void start() {
        LOG.debug(""Staring the PooledConnectionFactory: create on start = {}"", isCreateConnectionOnStartup());
        stopped.set(false);
        if (isCreateConnectionOnStartup()) {
            try {
                // warm the pool by creating a connection during startup
                createConnection();
            } catch (JMSException e) {
                LOG.warn(""Create pooled connection during start failed. This exception will be ignored."", e);
            }
        }
    }
{code}

So no close() method of PooledConnection is called and so no decrementReferenceCount is called on ConnectionPool. So referenceCount never becomes 0.
Later on if an exception occurs and hasExpired of ConnectionPool is set to true, the connection will not be closed since expiredCheck() method of ConnectionPool always compares referenceCount with 0 and does close() only if it is 0.

So we have a dead ConnectionPool instance and all usages result in ""XXX closed"" errors.

The fix would be to add call to close() just after doing createConnection() in PooledConnectionFactory#start() to make referenceCount go to 0. Something like this:

{code:java}
    public void start() {
        LOG.debug(""Staring the PooledConnectionFactory: create on start = {}"", isCreateConnectionOnStartup());
        stopped.set(false);
        if (isCreateConnectionOnStartup()) {
            try {
                // warm the pool by creating a connection during startup
                createConnection().close(); // <--- makes sure referenceCount goes to 0
            } catch (JMSException e) {
                LOG.warn(""Create pooled connection during start failed. This exception will be ignored."", e);

My confifuration is different though. I run 2 static brokers. 
I see these messages on both 5.10.0 and apache-activemq-5.11-20141222.222708-183. 5.9.0 works fine under exactly the same test hardware and configuration. It is highly reproducible.

The warnings in themselves are not a bad thing, there may actually be some duplicate sends under various conditions that need to be suppressed by the cursor if the producer audit is exhausted or a message is replayed across a network.
When you suggest that it works fine in 5.9, do you use the same metric? as in all messages sent are consumed? 
A valid test would need to verify each message is received once and once only.;;;","24/Dec/14 10:06;achernyakhovsky;Gary,

I will check the unit test module but I am afraid it might prove hard to replicate our environment.
Maybe it will be more productive if I work with you or someone assigned to this issue to understand what exactly is happening and then proceed with the test.

Here is some info:
1) Our production system consists of about half a dozen of servers running clients producing messages, then another set of about 10 consuming the load while producing some messages for consumption by themselves and another set of about 5 servers running apache storm. (The numbers change as we scale). 8 queues are created across the board.
2) We've ran into some reliability issues with the network of brokers while using AMQ 5.8.0 (transient) so we resorted to a single beefed up server.
3) Now we are on 5.10.0 and it is able to keep up with the current load but the load tends to grow and we would want to have some failover capability too.
4) I am running a load test for the same configuration as in production with 5, 7, 6 servers and again a beefy AMQ 5.10.0 server works fine.
5) When I add another AMQ server using static connector everything seems to work fine under lighter load. As load grows, even before the message consumption starts falling behind I am seeing a flood of the ""duplicate"" messages. They of course are not a problem by themselves but the DLQ fills up really quickly and AMQs die horrible out of memory death. Exactly the same behavior under the same setup and load is observed for the 5 or .11-SNAPSHOT (I basically swap the activemq link in the /opt folder)
6) Keeping the whole system the same, when I switch to 5.9.0 the issue disappears - no ""duplicate"" in the log, DLQ does not get populated.

So the question is what gives? The consumers seem to process all the messages at least it shouldn't be different from 5.9 to 5.10 to 5.11. Do you believe something has changed in 5.10 and it might be a legit behavior?

Let me know. I can provide additional details and assist with debugging if needed.
;;;","07/Jan/15 10:56;syberyan;Same problem over here with 5.10.0. Happens on a topic for us.
DLQ suddenly starts filling up with these messages:

So in some ways the difference between 5.9 and 5.10 is expected.
What is unknown is what exact scenario causes the behaviour you see.
The trigger for the duplicates I tracked in the past was queue memory limit being reached with concurrent producers to the same destination, some of which were transactional. The interleaving could leave the cursor and store out of sync, such that when the cursor needed to page in from the store, it would use the wrong start point.
Your trigger seems to be related to the network bridge, which would introduce a non transacted client ack consumer and non transacted producer. Maybe you can simulate that at load without the bridge.
We need to determine the sequence of events that lead to the duplicate from the store to understand if it is legitimate or not and if not, to ensure we don't fill the DLQ in this case.;;;","07/Jan/15 12:14;gtully;@Christian - can you verify against 5.11-SNAPSHOT and if the problem persists try and build a simple reproducible test case? There are a bunch of tests around https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5266 - peek at the activity tab. They may give inspiration.;;;","07/Jan/15 13:45;syberyan;@Gary: I managed to reproduce the problem with a local instance, maybe the following info might give you some insights.

- started a client publishing messages to a topic continuously 
- our camel application was consuming from that topic
- while everything was running ok, I restarted activemq
- the duplicate message warnings started appearing immediately after startup
- even after killing the client, the broker seems to be 'stuck' in this state. Each single message will trigger the warning from then on.
- not all 'duplicate' messages end up in the DLQ. Seems to be timing related. (Looks like the faster the machine, the less messages end up in the DLQ.)  
- reproducable both with an oracle and a kahadb store

I connected a debugger and noticed that the handling thread enters AbstractStoreCursor.recoverMessage() twice, hence the duplicate warning because it already exists in the audit map. PrefetchSubscription.add() seems to trigger the 2 executions, once through pending.addMessageLast(node) and once through dispatchPending()...

Here are 2 stacktraces showing how it enters that method.

From the source code of org.apache.activemq.broker.region.cursors.AbstractStoreCursor#recoverMess
age it looks like duplicates messages got stored in kahadb for same destination. The topic for which it happend has a durable subscriber. 
I want to understand in what cases kahadb stores duplicate messages ? Is this a bug?

In bin/activemq.bat, the following changes were made:

{code}-if ""%ACTIVEMQ_OPTS%"" == """" set ACTIVEMQ_OPTS=-Xms1G -Xmx1G -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties

If the directory that %ACTIVEMQ_CONF% resolves to contains a space (e.g. C:\Program Files\activemq), everything after the space is treated as a separate argument.  I was able to work around this by adding double quotes around the path in the last argument, i.e.:

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.activemq.jms.pool.PooledConnectionFactory.setConnectionFactory(Ljavax/jms/ConnectionFactory;)V

It seems to me that rather than changing the appropriate method signature taking a {{ConnectionFactory}} to accepting any {{Object}} because some XAConnectionFactory implementations do not properly implement {{ConnectionFactory}} is a bad way to go - introducing complexity where it is unneeded.  It would be far simpler to wrap those XAConnectionFactory with thin ConnectionFactory implementations.

Anyway, the damage is done here - if we change the signature back, another non-backward-compatible change will be introduced.

Can anybody make this test? 
May be I will make it later when I learn java basics and unit test creation. 

For my task I replaced usage of STOMP request by reading information from xml information page of Active MQ.;;;","06/Aug/14 11:04;nannou9;I have quickly written some messy unit test for this scenario.

Same stats message consumed from topic by TCP connector is ok while the one received by STOMP is 0- length.

So I can confirm that it is some stomp related problem.

Will try to look core of this issue.;;;","06/Aug/14 12:51;vchampion;Thank you Piotr! May be you create task with unit test in activemeq-stomp as Timothy suggested?;;;","06/Aug/14 13:30;nannou9;Yes, sure.
But just was curious what was the reason.
So the problem is combination of 2 reasons:
1. Stomp ProtocolConverter expects the stomp client to directly subscribe advisory addresses. So it will work when subscribing topic is prefixed with ""ActiveMQ.Advisory.""
2. Statistics plugin is kind of unique advisory system, as instead if directly subscribing advisory topic, you need to send a message with reply-to header. So when reply-to header and your reply topic has a name without ""ActiveMQ.Advisory."" prefix, then it fails as translator finder is assuming that destination (or rather source) is not and advisory one. It simply ueses wrong frame translator. It thinks that it is a byte or string message while it is map message.

So this method is source of this issue:
{code}
    protected FrameTranslator findTranslator(String header, ActiveMQDestination destination) {
        FrameTranslator translator = frameTranslator;
        try {
            if (header != null) {
                translator = (FrameTranslator) FRAME_TRANSLATOR_FINDER
                        .newInstance(header);
            } else {
                if (destination != null && AdvisorySupport.isAdvisoryTopic(destination)) {
                    translator = new JmsFrameTranslator();
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception ignore) {
            // if anything goes wrong use the default translator
        }

        if (translator instanceof BrokerContextAware) {
            ((BrokerContextAware)translator).setBrokerContext(brokerContext);
        }

        return translator;
    }

{code}

So I will try to prepare both: unit test and fix for this problem.

I've attached a testcase that successfully hits the NPE when the scheduler.start() method is delayed.

The first consumer enters the block and while it still has to perform the start() the second will find the first if condition if (result == null) false, hence it won't have the Timer object initialised and an exception is thrown.

I hope this explanation is clear enough;;;","02/Jun/14 07:56;Malli;Hi Timothy,

any update on this?;;;","04/Jun/14 13:48;tabish;Haven't had time to investigate as the test is quite large.  A simpler JUnit test case would be quicker to investigate otherwise this will have to wait.  In JMS land the Session is meant to be a single threaded resource to you can probably work around any issue here by giving each it's own Session instance. ;;;","24/Jun/14 09:06;Malli;Hi Timothy,

As I mentioned the problem is not related to the Session, but the Connection itself not being thread safe. We currently make use of a single Session per thread.

We both agree that an 'in frequently triggered' race condition doesnt exactly lend itself to a simple junit, but I believe that the test case I provided you with the actual patch should be quite straight-forward to test.;;;","18/Jul/14 08:28;Malli;Hi,

The default cleanup settings will reclaim space at first but over time it seems the size of the data directory will grow and never shrink back down to its original size.

I can reproduce this with a test that sends and consumes a large number of messages to a single queue (.net client, broker hosted on windows). The data file grows and will never shrink back down again.

    ""- because of timing inaccuracies, the receiver SHOULD be tolerant and take into account an error margin""

However, it appears that ActiveMQ 5.x is not tolerant of any error margin. 

Despite the fact that the spec says SHOULD rather than MUST it would make the implementation of STOMP clients easier if the error margin was published.

As the broker aggressively enforces the heart beat timeouts false failover attempts can result.

Apparently Apollo supports an error margin of 1.5x the configured heart beat. If it could be made configurable that would be even better!

;;;","02/May/14 07:26;surfnerd;Thanks [~dhirajsb] for the patch. I just tried it.

I see some weird behaviour:

Sorry if you have already done it, but did you test with a fresh activemq data directory? Older un-authorized subscriptions in broker store could cause weird behavior like you describe. Also, can you share your test code as a JUnit test case? 

Retained message behavior is still not sorted out, the patch should only affect non-retained messages.

Dhiraj. ;;;","04/May/14 05:55;surfnerd;Hi [~dhirajsb] ,

Yes. I cleaned data directory and weird behaviour is gone !

As you indicated, retained messages still don't follow authorization. Do you need any help in that direction ?;;;","05/May/14 08:23;dejanb;Patch applied. Thanks Dhiraj.

The problem is that we're managing these retained messages in the mqtt filter and sending it directly to the subscription. So it buy-passes all broker interceptors (including security ones). I think the better option would be to reuse subscription recovery policy mechanism

http://activemq.apache.org/subscription-recovery-policy.html

and adapt it for mqtt use-cases. I'll take a stub at refactoring this.;;;","06/May/14 20:43;dhirajsb;[~dejanb] How are you planning on adding the MQTT retained message recovery policy? In theory it should be added on the fly from the MQTT protocol converter when an MQTT client sends a message to a Topic. Also, if another recovery policy exists on the Topic, then the MQTT policy should act in parallel with it. What do you think? 
In general I like the idea of the recovery policy, since it would allow non-MQTT connections to receive retained messages too. 

Meanwhile, I opened a pull request https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/21 to add authorization for retained messages with the current approach.

Here, Topic is using LastImageSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy by default, with the filter to cache only message with specified header (which we set in mqtt filter).
The thing that still needs to be investigated is handling of duplicate subscriptions (as we can't do nothing anymore, but unsubscribe/subscribe to get retained messages). There's a test failing due to this and I need to see how we can fix that. Anyhow, I think this approach is more natural as the message will go through the whole stack of broker interceptors (and also allow retained message feature in jms land).

    Partial fix for AMQ-5160, attempts to resolve retained messages using subscription recovery policy, but fails to resend retained messages for duplicate subscriptions

----
;;;","08/May/14 02:15;dhirajsb;Hi [~dejanb], I took a look at the patch and fixed a couple of issues with it and have submitted a new PR https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/22. I created a new policy, which ensures that retained message policy won't get accidentally removed if user sets another policy. It also makes sure that existing subscriptions don't receive messages with the retained flag set, only new subscriptions do. However, its still not complete. 

It still has the problem of not being able to resend Retained messages for duplicate subscriptions. I don't see any way of being able to do that short of the approach you took in your patch to remove the existing subscription and create it again. But this goes against MQTT-3.8.4-3, which says the subscription must NOT be interrupted, i.e. pending messages should not be lost. So, recreating the sub breaks the test that looks for pending messages, and not recreating the sub breaks another test that looks for resent retained messages. 

From what I figure so far, a possible solution would be the hybrid of my earlier PR https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/21 (which walks 'up' the filter chain and finds the required SecurityContext to perform authorization in the MQTTProtocolConverter), and a RetainedMessageSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy to let non-MQTT clients also receive Retained messages (which is filtered out in the MQTTProtocolConverter so MQTT clients don't receive duplicates). 

Unless you can think of some trick to resend retained messages for a duplicate sub without removing it, I don't see any other way of being able to make it work for both MQTT and non-MQTT clients. ;;;","08/May/14 02:18;dhirajsb;[~surfnerd], you need to rebuild the module activemq-broker too. BTW, don't combine PR 21 and 22, since they are alternative solutions to this problem.

I had a discussion with Dejan about the other option of using Retroactive consumers, and I believe I have come up with a solution in PR22 that works elegantly for both MQTT and JMS clients. 

Can you test PR-22 with your test client and verify that it works? Since it includes major changes to MQTT transport and minor changes to Broker core classes, it should be thoroughly tested and validated before being applied.

Thanks for validating PR22. If you tested with PR24 that should be good, since it includes commits from PR22. We could just as well apply PR24 directly to ActiveMQ trunk. Also, are you testing Virtual Topics too, it is a pretty cool feature I added. I've written a post about it at http://rockablogbaby.blogspot.com/2014/05/scalable-iot-integration-using-apache.html

I have created a patch for activemq 5.9.1 version that seems to work.

These are my changes for org.apache.activemq.transport.ws.StompSocket:

1. in doStart() I set transportListener to remove NPE:
{code}
@Override
    protected void doStart() throws Exception {
        socketTransportStarted.countDown();
		stompInactivityMonitor.setTransportListener(this.getTransportListener());
    }
{code}

2. in onMessage(String data) I managed keepalive frame:
{code}
if (!transportStartedAtLeastOnce()) {
            LOG.debug(""Waiting for StompSocket to be properly started..."");
            try {
                socketTransportStarted.await();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                LOG.warn(""While waiting for StompSocket to be properly started, we got interrupted!! Should be okay, but you could see race conditions..."");
            }
        }
        try {
	      if (data!=null && data.equals(""\n""))
		{
		    sendToActiveMQ(new KeepAliveInfo());
		}
	      else {
		   protocolConverter.onStompCommand((StompFrame)wireFormat.unmarshal(new ByteSequence(data.getBytes(""UTF-8""))));
		}
        } catch (Exception e) {
            onException(IOExceptionSupport.create(e));
        }
{code}

5) Half of the chat ends up in one browser, and half in the other.

Can someone confirm this?;;;","09/Apr/15 17:14;tabish;This is not a bug, the default address  string in that example is: /queue/test which means that the messages are load balanced across connections, try it with /topic/test and it should work as expected. ;;;","09/Apr/15 17:28;chadkelly;You are correct, using /topic/test works as expected.

Can someone confirm this bug occurs in their environment? If so, this bug relates to AMQ-5155 and AMQ-4674. I recommend that the ActiveMQ WebSocket example should work as is, regardless of using parameters like transport.hbGracePeriodMultiplier. Using Fedora/Firefox would cause the bug 50% of the times after 50-500 PINGs, but NO bug to report in Fedora/Chrome because of timing conditions.

The bug manifests itself in ""/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/AbstractInactivityMonitor.java"" when the timing of onCommand() (generated by the web browser PING or message) crosses over the timing of readCheck(). In other words, the 10 second timing of onCommand() via web browser's PING occurs before  the 10 second thread timing of readCheck(), but with a small time drift, the timing of readCheck() starts to occur before onCommand(). At this exact cross over point,  readCheck() will occur twice, and this will cause the bug. In the log below, the timing sequence is:
17:05:21,162 | DEBUG | onCommand()
17:05:21,162 | DEBUG | readCheck()
17:05:31,162 | DEBUG | readCheck()

The included patch will give the read check thread a 2nd chance (via 1 second) before exception and termination. It also designs the read check thread and write check thread to be nearly identical. I will implement other approaches should this one NOT be satisfactory. The attached patchfile.txt is for “/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/AbstractInactivityMonitor.java”.

I believe there is a fundamental design problem with AMQ heartbeats, because the timing of web browsers heartbeats has a cadence equal to the timing for AMQ to check heartbeats. Eventually, due to very small changes in time, the web browser heartbeat can eventually cross over AMQ checks for heartbeats. In the included example, the web browser client is sending at the rate of 10 seconds, and AMQ server is also checking at the rate of 10 seconds. Longer term testing, with a variety of websocket enabled browsers, show that the heartbeats can cross over. ;;;","21/Apr/15 23:59;chadkelly;Please retest 5.12-SNAPSHOT in your environment using Firefox.

create a different durable on testing.durable.test
send message to testing.durable.>

restart broker

when you look at the subscribers all durables are tied to testing.durable.test

this happens because the consumers get added to all matching subscribers creating them in the LevelDB store, but because the store does not store the subscribedDestination on a restart levelDB loses the durable's real topic.

that shows this works correctly. If you can alter that unit test to show failure, then we can take a closer look.

let us know!;;;","25/Apr/15 03:33;badavis;I did not get enough time to go through your test and change it to show the issue.  I did go through what I did before and reproduced the bug.   I also think I know what is wrong with your test.

If you do the steps I stated on a broker that you can restart (kill the process and bring back a new process) it will show the bug.  I did my test through the web console and the bug is still there on 5.11.1.  The key is restarting the broker.  I believe that is also the issue with your test.  You never get a new broker you reuse a broker, stopping  and starting it.  My guess is the LevelDBPersistentAdapter probably does not get rid of state on the stop of a broker and reuses that state on a start.

Hope this helps.

;;;","15/Apr/16 08:04;osmanrafiq;Hi guys,

We are having an issue related (the same?) to the one [~badavis] is describing on both ActiveMQ 5.11.1 and 5.12.2.

From our loggings it seems that the Level DB adapter somehow replaces the *subscribedDestination* field of SubscriptionInfo with the *desitnation* field.
Before restart (what is being sent to LevelDB):
2016-04-14 15:23:21,601 | DEBUG | alphabet.a store adding subscription: SubscriptionInfo {*subscribedDestination = topic://alphabet.>, destination = topic://alphabet.a*, clientId = CFH.BO.TCS, subscriptionName = alphabet.>, selector = null} | org.apache.activemq.store.LoggingTopicMessageStore | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///10.0.6.1:55924@61616

After restart (what broker is reading back from LevelDB):
2016-04-14 15:24:15,774 | DEBUG | Restoring durable subscription: SubscriptionInfo {*subscribedDestination = topic://alphabet.a, destination = null*, clientId = CFH.BO.TCS, subscriptionName = alphabet.>, selector = null} | org.apache.activemq.broker.region.TopicRegion

I have attached an updated version of the previously mentioned unit test to  verify the issue hopefully.

Note that the bug alone is not that severe as the TopicRegion correctly replaces the restored faulty subscription when reconnecting the durable subscriber. 

However, if the broker is being used with broker plugins (especially the authorization/authentication plugins) then the TopicRegion is not able to replace the faulty subscription and you end up having a ghost subscriber.;;;","19/Apr/16 13:54;jira-bot;Commit b027e655538226b56f1fe277a426e0df41501fc6 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

Contention is over pagedInPendingDispatchLock and checkpointLock.
The problem is that we're expiring messages under the pagedInPendingDispatchLock, so the solution is to change this and use the same pattern as we do with pagedInMessages expiry.
Using optimizedDispatch=false or expireMessagesPeriod=0 will workaround the issue.

If messages are to be expired they get sent to ActiveMQ.DLQ by default. See stack trace in next comment.

If the broker is security enabled with authorization turned on and messages get sent to DLQ as a result of the expiry check then the broker uses the client's security context when sending the messages to DLQ. 
This implies the client user needs to have write access to ActiveMQ.DLQ. 

As this may happen with any other client, all client users will require write access to ActiveMQ.DLQ, which may not be appropriate from a security point of view. 

The broker regularly runs an expiry check and uses a broker internal security context for this task. In my opinion this same broker internal security context should be used when expiring messages as part of the RemoveInfo command. The broker should not use the client's security context.

The current behavior can raise the following SecurityException if the client user does not have write access to ActiveMQ.DLQ

1)
The quick solution is to grant write permissions to user 'Test' but potentially other users could be affected as well and may also need write permissions for ActiveMQ.DLQ. In the worst case all users may require write permissions to ActiveMQ.DLQ.

2)
In case you don't care about these expired messages you can also configure the broker to simply discard expired messages using this configuration within the policyEntry config

{code:xml}
<deadLetterStrategy>
  <sharedDeadLetterStrategy processExpired=""false"" />
</deadLetterStrategy>
{code}

as per http://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html. Then the permission problem won't arise.

It is decremented on commit but not on rollback. This has quite bad consequences since after some time depending on the system memory usage settings and amount of rolled back messages, the broker starts to reject messages saying that Usage Manager memory limit is reached. The only solution is to restart the broker.
I created a small Maven project (see the attachment) with a unit test starting an embedded broker and two test methods: one sending messages with session.commit and another with session.rollback(). The last one fails to assert the memory usage. In the output one can see quite a lot of error logs written by ActiveMQ. The problem is reproducible with 5.8.0 and 5.9.0.
The problem seems to be in org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Topic#doMessageSend method where a transaction synchronization is registered. In the transaction synchronization only afterCommit is supplied, but no afterRollback. So there seems to be nobody calling message.decrementReferenceCount().

Both the broker and the hanging clients can't be easily shut down when this happens - only forcefully applied kill's do the job.

I'm using queues and transactional sessions. All clients (producers and consumers) are in the same Java VM. There is only one JMS connection between the application and the broker. Each client has its own session, but they all share the same connection.

Normally, the data directory of the LevelDb contains only a few log files. But in my case, the number of log files is steadily increasing.

Furthermore, I was able to track down the issue to following circumstance: The problem only occurs, when consumers do a rollback instead of a commit when they receive the message. The rollback / redelivery works as expected - the same message is received again after a previous rollback.

As far as I can tell, the problem does not occur with KahaDb.

I'll attach a test program that provokes the error. It sets up a few hundred queues, consumers and producers. The consumers just receive the message and commit the session, but they also do ""random"" rollbacks. It can be observed immediately that the number of files starts increasing in the data directory. After a few minutes, the clients hang - sometimes sooner, sometimes later. I'll also attach the config file for the broker.

I am aware, that heavy rollbacking should not happen in normal operation. But from a long term stability perspective, this is a blocker for us.

http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/ActiveMQ-message-dequeuing-hangs-td4681366.html

I've gone through the code, and I agree with his findings.

I've attached a patch to 5.9.2 based on this, in which LevelDBStore uses an internal private lock variable instead of _this_, which removes the deadlock that can happen when the LocalTransaction synchronises externally on the transactionStore during a rollback.

Using this patch, the original (attached) test runs for hours without deadlocking, as do my own tests that previously deadlocked after a few thousand messages.

Sent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.
;;;","07/Jul/14 21:55;tabish;Reviewed all the mailing list discussion and the threads dumps and the analysis is correct, the lock cannot be the LevelDBStore object since that can lead to  a lock in the hawtDispatch serialization thread runner if a task is modifying mutable state and needs to protect data that also accessible on the public store API. 

Patch applied with thanks. ;;;","08/Jul/14 02:54;badavis;Awesome that this is getting fixed.  Thank you James for fixing this.  I apologize if this is the wrong form for this, I am new to this type of development.  The other issue I noticed from my analysis is the GCPolling job and the rollback job got scheduled to the same thread at the same time in the hawtdispatcher.  It just so happens that the GCPoll job got ran first.  My system had many dispatch threads available but all the jobs only went to the one dispatch thread causing the deadlock.  Could you tell me the reasoning this is not a concern?  I personally would like to understand this better.  Thank you.

Brian;;;","08/Jul/14 14:07;tabish;The reason is simple, the serial execution of tasks protects from concurrent modification of mutable state in the LeveDB store.  If the tasks executed on multiple threads concurrently then the code would need to be drastically more protective of all mutable state in the store and you'd see a lot more locking and most likely threading related bugs. The reason for the small number of synchronized areas is to protect those bits that are exposed by the persistence adapter API which need to read or modify some things that are also modified on the dispatch thread.  ;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also tried using the failover transport, shutting down the broker, restarting all the clients, bringing the broker back up, and then shutting it down again.

In this second test case, the message was only redelivered one time.  Since the multiple deliveries only happen as the broker is shutting down, the shutdown of each connection is leading to redelivery to another consumer on another connection, and in the errant case, the second connection to shutdown (out of 3) happens to be the next one to which the message is delivered.  Therefore, the last connection remaining also gets the message.  Like this:

* Consumer 1 gets message
* Consumer 1 connection shuts down
* Consumer 2 gets message
* Consumer 2 connection shuts down
* Consumer 3 gets message
* Consumer 3 connection shuts down

Bottom line - the broker should not be redelivering (or even delivering) any messages during shutdown.  Not sure if this will be an easy fix though, since the broker sends messages (advisories) to advise of things like shutting down consumers.

;;;","18/Mar/14 23:05;artnaseef;Problem exists on 5.10-SNAPSHOT.;;;","19/Mar/14 02:48;artnaseef;Looking at this more closely, I'm leaning toward this being a non-problem.

The JMS specification states this for AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE:

{quote}
AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE - With this option, the session automatically acknowledges a client’s receipt of a message when it has either successfully returned from a call to receive or the MessageListener it has called to process the message successfully returns.
{quote}

This means that MessageListener *must* be prepared to handle duplicates coming into the {{onMessage}} call because (a) the message does not get acknowledged until the handler returns, and (b) there's always the chance that client application will fail between the {{onMessage}} call and the message ACK (leading to redeliveries).

Really, all client apps should be prepared to handle duplicates, although transacted applications are best positioned to avoid them.

While it may be possible to improve this one case, such a change is not trivial, and such a change would not prevent the same condition from requiring handling in the client.;;;","19/Mar/14 13:04;gtully;there may be an easy fix in org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue#removeSubscription. Don't do further dispatch if the broker is shutting down. this would avoid the cascade effect of dispatch to each closing connection in order. essentially gate the call to wakeup with a check on broker shutdown.;;;","19/Mar/14 13:34;artnaseef;Thanks Gary - I'll take a look at that; if it proves to be straight-forward and effective, I'll put it in there.;;;","27/Mar/14 15:16;artnaseef;Fixed Queue handling to avoid re-dispatch of unacked messages on removal of a consumer when the broker is shutting down.

Includes a unit test.  There is a race condition in the tests which appears to be in between removal of all the queue's consumers and the resend logic on the Queue which causes false positives (i.e. failure to detect a problem), so the test runs up to 3 iterations in an attempt to increase reliability.;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MQTT requires that all Publish messages with QoS > 0 must have a unique packet id which can be used by clients to coordinate the PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL and PUBCOMP messages depending upon the QoS flow. 

Although retained messages published on creation of client subscriptions are copies of retained messages, they must carry a unique packet id when dispatched to clients. ActiveMQ re-uses the retained message's packet id, which makes it difficult to acknowledge these messages when wildcard topics are used. 

ActiveMQ also sends the same non-retained message multiple times for every matching subscription for overlapping subscriptions. These messages also re-use the publisher's message id as the packet id, which breaks client acknowledgment. 

A patch is included, which fixes all the above scenarios. It generates a unique packet id for every publish (retained and non-retained), and also ensures that redelivery on the same connection will re-use message ids, with the dup flag set. The patch also maps JMS redelivery status for a subscription to the MQTT Dup flag to indicate duplicate messages. Unit tests are included to test correct packet id generation.

I was able to reproduce the error, but the failure doesn't happen every time the tests are run. I investigated a little more and looks like its related to AMQ-4712. The tests fail when the client apparently reads the same SUBACK packet twice, even though the server only sends it once. 

Since the same tests have no issues in the non-SSL MQTTTest, it seems like an issue in SslProtocolCodec.secure_read(). But I am not familiar with the code so can't narrow it down further. 

Can we mark the failing test as ignored in MQTTSSLTest for now, and get the fix in for non-SSL case? 

Thanks,
Dhiraj. ;;;","11/Mar/14 20:35;dhirajsb;On further testing, it doesn't seem to be happening in SslProtocolCodec.secure_read().

It is coming from: 
http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Inflight-Count-for-topics-not-correct-td4678407.html#a4678583


Problem:  Inflight count is not going down for topics once consumer is disconnected or sent acknowledgements for the messages it has received.
For topics once inflight count is increased, it is never going back down. 


Test Scenario: 
When a producer and a consumer connected to the broker but consumer is little bit slow, there will be inflight messages in the broker which are not yet acknowledged. 
Case 1 :Now after some time when consumer acknowledged the messages, than inflight count should decrease, but that is not happening for topics.
Case 2 :Now If at this point of time, I stop consumer broker should make inflight count to '0' because those messages are not inflight now. (for queue these are now held messages and for topic those messages are dropped). But when I check in Jconsole, I found that: for a queue it is working fine and going down to 0 but for topics inflight count is not changing.



Test Case: I tested with normal java consumer subscribing to a topic, I put thread.sleep(5000) while receiving messages. Now consumer will take time to acknowledge messages which are received. So that we can see inflight messages. 
Now after 5 seconds, consumer has received the messages and also sent acknowledgement to the broker but inflight count is not decreasing. Now if I disconnects consumer inflight count should go down to '0', again here also it is not changing for that topic.

The broker service is started in a seperate thread

the client connection is started first. but surprisingly it tries start the brokers transport connector. An apparent glitch follows when the broker service stops and re-start the transport.

I look into the activemq source and saw this:

BrokerService.class
{code}
public void start() throws Exception {
[...]
    // in jvm master slave, lets not publish over existing broker till we get the lock
    final BrokerRegistry brokerRegistry = BrokerRegistry.getInstance();
    if (brokerRegistry.lookup(getBrokerName()) == null) {
            brokerRegistry.bind(getBrokerName(), BrokerService.this);
    }
    startPersistenceAdapter(startAsync);
    startBroker(startAsync);
    brokerRegistry.bind(getBrokerName(), BrokerService.this);
{code}

VMTransportFactory.class
{code}
    private BrokerService lookupBroker(final BrokerRegistry registry, final String brokerName, int waitForStart) {
        BrokerService broker = null;
        synchronized(registry.getRegistryMutext()) {
            broker = registry.lookup(brokerName);
            if (broker == null && waitForStart > 0) {
                final long expiry = System.currentTimeMillis() + waitForStart;
                while (broker == null  && expiry > System.currentTimeMillis()) {
                    long timeout = Math.max(0, expiry - System.currentTimeMillis());
                    try {
                        LOG.debug(""waiting for broker named: "" + brokerName + "" to start"");
                        registry.getRegistryMutext().wait(timeout);
                    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
                    }
                    broker = registry.lookup(brokerName);
                }
            }
        }
        return broker;
    }
{code}

It appears that create=false and waitForStart only waits for the broker to be added to the BrokerRegistry. However when the brokerService is starts, it seems that the broker is added to the registry before it is started.

I believe some synchronization is missing make the VMTransportFactory wait for the broker not only to be added to the registry, but also fully started.

The leading and trailing '/' in MQTT is significant. 

The '/' character in MQTT paths and filters is mapped to '.' in ActiveMQ, which leads to names like '.TopicA' and 'TopicA.'. However, ActiveMQ ignores empty path levels, although, they are just as significant for ActiveMQ. Although these path names are not common in ActiveMQ, which maybe the reason why the issue hasn't been discovered until now. 

ActiveMQ needs to treat empty levels as significant, and pattern match accordingly. This requires change to ActiveMQDestination.getDestinationPaths() and some code cleanup in DestinationMap related classes and Destination filtering classes.

From MQTT 3.1.1 draft specification

[MQTT-3.1.3-6] A Server MAY allow a Client to supply a ClientId that has a length of zero bytes.
However if it does so the Server MUST treat this as a special case and assign a
unique ClientId to that Client. It MUST then process the CONNECT packet as if
the Client had provided that unique ClientId.
[MQTT-3.1.3-7] If the Client supplies a zero-byte ClientId, the Client MUST also set Clean
Session to 1.
[MQTT-3.1.3-8] If the Client supplies a zero-byte ClientId with Clean Session set to 0, the Server
MUST respond to the CONNECT Packet with a CONNACK return code 0x02
(Identifier rejected) and then close the Network Connection.
[MQTT-3.1.3-9] If the Server rejects the ClientId it MUST respond to the CONNECT Packet with
a CONNACK return code 0x02 (Identifier rejected) and then close the Network
Connection.",,dhirajsb,tabish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"17/Feb/14 17:12;dhirajsb;AMQ-5058.patch;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12629400/AMQ-5058.patch",,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,374065,,,Mon Feb 17 17:36:27 UTC 2014,,,,,,,Patch Available,,,,"0|i1sgn3:",374365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"17/Feb/14 17:12;dhirajsb;Patch for adding support for zero length client id;;;","17/Feb/14 17:36;tabish;applied on trunk;;;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reproduce:
1. Download fresh copy and install 
2. Edit conf/activemq.xml and change broker line to 
<broker xmlns=""http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"" brokerName=""localhost"" dataDirectory=""${activemq.data}"" schedulerSupport=""true""> 

3. Go to admin console and create a topic, http://localhost:8161/admin/topics.jsp
4. Go to admin console and create durable subscriber to topic above http://localhost:8161/admin/subscribers.jsp
5. Delete the durable subscriber using link on same page and it will fail 

Repeat all steps above but this time set schedulerSupport=false. Then it will delete the durable without any errors.

The container that runs the war (like Jetty or Tomcat) will compile the JSP's so there is no need for the eclipse core compiler.   Also, there isn't a need for the jetty jars.  It looks like there was an attempt to exclude those from packaging anyway via maven-war-plugin configs, but those configs aren't working.

The scala stuff in activemq-leveldb-store causes problems if you generate an eclipse project using the maven-eclipse-plugin.   Couple things need to be done:

1) Add the scala nature so its created as a scala project instead of java

2) Add the scala dirs as source dirs so eclipse see's them as source and will compile them.

The defect causes activemq client to perform badly when receiving message that sequence id is bigger than max interger. It spends most of the time to shift window, and also blocks other consumer threads. Below is the jstack log that shows the problem.

The issue is internal to the Proton engine and with the current implementation there's not a whole lot we can do to workaround it short of lifting their SASL parsing code and doing the processing ourselves without trigger SASL support in the proton code.

I was able to create a patch for the proton code that works although causes some of their tests to fail. The end result was that the time on my machine to send a 10mb message went from 30+ seconds to around 300ms or so.

AbortSlowAckConsumer0Test contains 3 new test cases and 1 test case that was overridden from it's base class, AbortSlowConsumerTest.

I don't think these tests ever actually ran though, perhaps because of a bug with CombinationTestSupport.  As a result, this line of code in createBroker was never executed:

AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy strategy = (AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy) underTest;

This cast doesn't work, so I updated the corresponding code in AbortSlowAckConsumer0Test.  The test now gets the errors below.  I'm not sure if this is because of my conversion, or if they never would have worked.  I will add @Ignore for now for all failing tests cases.

when trying to browse that queue.

To reproduce it:

1. Start a broker with default configuration

2. Send 200k messages with

{code}ant producer -Dmax=200000 -Ddurable=true -Dsubject=TEST{code}

3. Try to browse the queue

http://localhost:8161/admin/browse.jsp?JMSDestination=TEST

The proper solution to this problem is to implement proper pagination while browsing the messages, so users can browse through all messages showing 100 msgs (or so) at the time and not using all the available memory.

Why is this a bug and why is this a blocker? The console was designed to keep messages in memory. Obviously past a certain limit one would run out of memory. What I understand is that you actually require an improvement, which would be probably major, not even critical for the console to use pagination to handle a limited number of messages.

I would argue that for extremely large messages even 100 msgs per page would probably be too much. I also find your suggestion to use pagination a bit lacking, as if one would have 200k messages in the queue pagination would definitely not help and more advanced features like (multi-faceted) filtering would be necessary. 

A good place to start is documenting the limitations of the current console.;;;","28/Jan/14 12:29;dejanb;In my opinion, anything that can cause broker (a vital middleware infrastructure component) to crash in production with OOM should be considered a blocker bug.;;;","28/Jan/14 15:33;zmhassan;Hi,

I had a similar problem when I was building BZCareer.com search engine where I had half a million records in the database that I wanted to show to users. I couldn't just send half a million JSON objects from the server to the client because it's just too much data. Rather I gave them the first 10 records per page. 

For that reason I have to agree with Dejan regarding his suggestion for adding pagination. 

Users don't need to see 200,000 records on a single page. Only maybe 100 records per page. 

If everyone agrees with this I can write the client side JavaScript to generate pagination and get data asynchronously. I can also write the server side code that will return a JSON object with the first hundred records and subsequent records from specifying in the query string 'page=#'.


/admin/browse.jsp?JMSDestination=TEST&page=1
Note: Page=1 is the first 100 records and so on...

I think pagination added to the console would solve this issue. With every decision we can weigh the benefit vs the cost. If this is a benefit that has no cost then why not implement this or better yet why not let me implement this as a matter of fact.

One suggestion: what if instead of using one ""page"" parameter in URL you'd use two ""from"" and ""to"" parameters to specify the message range explicitly? It's semantically equivalent. On the page you can still display pages with a little bit of arithmetic in js.;;;","28/Jan/14 15:56;zmhassan;
Great suggestion Hadrian. I have logic in the code to do that. I will be using similar code found on this page: 

http://www.bzcareer.com/CA/search?keyword=Developer&local=
Note: view source to see how I did it.

As you can see you won't see a from or to anywhere in the query string. It's all handled via Ajax. 'from' and 'to' we don't need to expose to the user however I was planning on including a single parameter to avoid confusion 'page=#'. 

How about we add a drop down where a user can choose how many items will display per page ?

;;;","28/Jan/14 16:12;hadrian;Sure. Either that or profile settings, whatever you think is best. That can be easily changed if needed without changing the url structure and the rest of the logic.;;;","29/Jan/14 21:21;zmhassan;I'm able to generate pagination on the UI when the requests are small but I seem to be getting an error from the server-side ""java.lang out of memory .... "" when messages when the queue depth is large. I'm searching for where this bug is coming from. Pagination may sort of help but we still need to find some way of limiting the amount of messages that get displayed.
I narrowed down where the problem is coming from I suspect that is somewhere in:

https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/trunk/activemq-web-console/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/web/controller/SendMessage.java#L51-L79

Also I can imagine that there could me more messages being produced and consumed at the same time which we have to consider. Any suggestions on possible options?

This is just a start, still need to actually remove the sitemesh stuff, delete the various sitemesh specific files, etc...;;;","30/Jan/14 02:58;artnaseef;On the pagination with messages being produced and consumed - I wouldn't worry about it.  Messages may be consumed or produced all the time meaning the web UI can never be fully correct.

To keep the UI as consistent as possible, perhaps the simplest approach is to just show only one page at a time.;;;","30/Jan/14 03:45;zmhassan;I was originally planning on making a slight change in the design. I was planning on making a restful endpoint that will display the first hundred JMS messages in queue in JSON format (one argument 'page'). It would save time and resource because we don't loop through all 200,000 items in queue. However that would make a change in the design and I was thinking there must be a way that we can reuse existing code that does web service like functionality. 

One option I was looking at was that we could use the RSS/ATOM feed with xml data and pull from it via javascript on the client-side to get the messages in queue but when I tried this, it was a really large xml file and takes a long time to load. When the number of messages grow too large I was unsuccessful in requesting it and parsing it. Perhaps if we can just display 100 messages of the 200,000 in queue that would make it an easier problem to solve. 

http://localhost:8161/admin/queueBrowse/TEST?view=rss&feedType=atom_1.0


Here is an example of how I will get the xml data from JavaScript just in case anyone would like to see the code:

;;;","30/Jan/14 05:25;artnaseef;Looking at the broker code, it should be feasible to modify the code to return a specific ""page"" of messages.  Probably pass a start message # and end message #, or start and count.

One concern is that the current method of returning messages is using ActiveMQQueueBrowser to iterate through messages, making the operation to skip to the first message requested inefficient.  One way to reduce that concern could be caching the browser in the web session.  Still looking through the code to see what's feasible on that front.

Another concern is what feasible limits do we attempt to address?  For example, message sizes on the order of the broker's available memory size are going to be impossible to process.  More realistically, should the solution assume that one page of messages will fit in memory?;;;","30/Jan/14 05:33;artnaseef;Hmm, looking at the JMX destination browsing code, it looks like it may only support up to 200 messages maximum.  Is that correct?;;;","30/Jan/14 05:43;artnaseef;OK, so the JMX view (browse operation on the DestinationView MBean) only supports up to 400 messages.  Found in the code and confirmed with a test (involving a lot of mouse clicks and funny stares from family members).

It would be very simple to limit the web console in the same way.;;;","30/Jan/14 15:20;dejanb;In my opinion it would be the best to move off the JMS interface for browsing and do it over JMX. Next, the JMX interface should be improved to allow browsing of all available messages (at the moment that are messages that are paged in memory, but in the future we should be able to browse the whole store), in reasonable sized batches.;;;","30/Jan/14 15:24;dkulp;
Could a new JIRA be created for the pagination stuff?   That's more of a feature request.

github pull request which removes sitemesh which is the root cause of the OOM:

https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/10

(and the OOM COULD occur on other pages such as if there are 200K queues or similar.  This pull request fixes those as well.)
;;;","30/Jan/14 15:47;artnaseef;Ditto on the desire to move the entire solution to JMX - a separate ticket should be entered for that.  Dejan - will you take the lead on that effort?

Let's keep this issue about the OOM.  I think the paging solution is a nicer way to go, but we could simply limit the number of messages returned from here in the same way JMX does.  The down side being that it reduces existing functionality.

I'll keep working toward a paging solution - it's feeling close.;;;","31/Jan/14 18:46;zmhassan;Okay at this point I'm just testing the client side code. Every page will display 100 Jms Messages and as we paginate through it will show the next 100. I can do some optimizations but wanted  your input on the design of it. Changed a bit of the UI to look more modern using bootstrap and jQuery. 

See screenshoot:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8wgkae6vpgrc21/Screenshot%20from%202014-01-31%2013%3A35%3A31.png


This was done by utilizing Bootstrap 3.0 css + jQuery + teamwork  to get RSS feed data from  ActiveMQ for the first 100 messages in the queue. As we go deeper the slower it will be. I'm working on a way around that but still thinking at this point. Appreciate any feedback I'll be online at the usual times > 7pm (E.S.T).

I'll send in my pull request once I'm satisfied that everything is working 100%  test and fully functional.

Zak

;;;","31/Jan/14 22:04;hadrian;Patch committed with thanks to Dan Kulp.

There is no OOME thrown, tried in both Mozilla and Chrome. Without the pagination feature it takes a long time for the page to refresh. Mozilla appears to be hanging and you get a standardista-table-sorting.js unresponsive (line 404) and you have the option to continue or stop the script. Either way, the browser doesn't crash and there is no exception. 

In Chrome it's a bit nicer because of the incremental page rendering the browser is responsive at all times. One could stop loading the page though.

I even tested with two browsers trying to load the content of the TEST queue at the same time. No problems other than the large amount of memory used and longer delays in accessing the net, which is to be expected.

I believe that although the OOME issue is resolved, pagination and search features are necessary if one needs to deal with deep queues. Let's track those features as separate improvement issues.;;;","31/Jan/14 22:19;zmhassan;@Hadrian,

Memory leak in ConnectionStateTracker when browsing non-empty queues,AMQ-4977,12689388,Bug,Resolved,AMQ,ActiveMQ,software,bsnyder,"<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/"">Apache ActiveMQ</a> is the most popular and powerful open source Message Broker.

We see memory leaks connected to this bug and after good amount of headbanging I think the problem is in how two methods work together - processMessagePull and trackBack. The first one has this piece of code:
{code}
  // leave a single instance in the cache
            final String id = pull.getDestination() + ""::"" + pull.getConsumerId();
            messageCache.put(id.intern(), pull);
{code}
while the second one unconditionally increases the currentCacheSize - regardless if the previous method added or replaced entry in the cache.

The situation where entries will be replaced (and not added) and the currentCacheSize will grow very fast until it wraps around and becomes negative is the following:
* have some logic that frequently creates queue browser and iterates through all the entries
* have the queue most of the time with at least one message. The more messages in the queue the faster currentCacheSize grows.

The reason is that processMessagePull reuses the consumer and destination ID for each browsed message in the queue when org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQQueueBrowser#hasMoreElements is invoked. trackBack is ignorant of this and keeps adding to the size regardless that the cache size stays the same.

Here is log from reproducing the issue as a proof:

One can see that the garbage collection works well (cache does not grow) but the currentCacheSize keeps increasing
Unfortunately I cannot easily extract the original code and provide it. Hope the explanation is clear enough.

I am working on it. Any good way to unit test this without actually creating files on disk?  I plan to put files in a subdir of target.

;;;","15/Jan/14 22:09;tabish;Since you are testing persistence you kind of have to write to disk.  That said there's a ton of unit tests to work from, I'd recommend you take a peek at QueuePurgeTest.java in activemq-unit-tests;;;","15/Jan/14 22:12;gtully;@Arthur - there is no problem with creating files in the target dir. that is what most of the store unit tests do.

""mvn test"" runs the test.

I'm not reproducing the failures with this test.  Trying to consider what may be different.  One thing coming to mind is that my earlier test involved running the broker in console mode and using ctrl-c to stop it.;;;","16/Jan/14 03:25;artnaseef;Looks like the difference is ActiveMQConnection.destroyDestination() versus BrokerView.removeQueue().;;;","16/Jan/14 16:06;artnaseef;Updated AMQ4970Test.zip so it now tests both the ActiveMQConnection.destroyDestination() and BrokerView.deleteQueue() methods.

Still not reproducing the problem this way.

Tried another approach (capturing kahadb snapshots):

== part 1 ==
* Clear the kahadb
* Start the broker
* Create two destinations
* Stop the broker
* Take snapshot 1 of the kahadb
* Start the broker
* Remove one destination
* Stop the broker
* Take snapshot 2 of the kahadb
* Start the broker
* Confirm errant operation (removed destination recreated)

== part 2 ==
* Stop the broker
* Clear the kahadb
* Start the broker
* Create 2 destinations
* Remove 1 destination
* Stop the broker
* Capture snapshot 3 of the kahadb
* Start the broker
* Confirm correct operation (destination remains removed)

Comparing Snapshots 2 and 3, there are differences (as expected):

* The db.redo file contains the removed destination name in the errant process path.
* The db.redo file in the normal path does not contain the removed destination name.
* And the normal path has a db.free file.
* The errant path does not.

I'm wondering if something in the out-of-the-box configs differing from the internal broker in the AMQ4970Test is contributing to the problem.

Any ideas would be welcome.;;;","17/Jan/14 04:13;artnaseef;Trying the exact same config with leveldb, the problem does not happen.;;;","17/Jan/14 05:15;artnaseef;This is interesting - turned on DEBUG logging on org.apache.activemq.broker.region and found this:

After pulling down the head and testing, the test passes.  I'm trying to track down the change that appears to fix the problem to understand why it makes the test pass - in case it doesn't truly fix the root cause.;;;","19/Jan/14 03:36;artnaseef;Here's the finding:

* The issue is caused, at least in part, by redundant starts of the Queue (i.e. two calls to Queue.start)
* On the head, this still happens
* On the older code, the redundant start causes redundant exipred-message scheduling which appears to cause the Queue to revive after a removeDestination
** The revival only takes affect on broker restart
** So, the kahadb remembers the destination, but it doesn't revive in broker memory
* On the head, the redundant start doesn't lead to the revival; not sure why.

I recommend protecting against redundant starts by adding a flag and check to the Queue - using encapsulation to have the Queue keep itself robust.  Even without the queue revival, redundant starts of the Queue can only lead to problems (such as a scheduler task leak).  I'll submit a patch. ;;;","19/Jan/14 07:01;artnaseef;Attaching a patch that prevents duplicate starts and stops of a single org.apache.broker.region.Queue.
